## An Introducton to St Augustne of Hippo

(Not to be confused with St Augustine of Canterbury!)
Dates: 354 – 430. ie. All of his life was lived in the post-Constantnian world.
A key source oor our knowledge oo his lioe was his Confessions, which is a spiritual autobiography
and one oo the earliest examples oo this genre. It takes the oorm oo a long prayer to God.
Key works: Augustne was a prolifc writer, with comoortably over a hundred surviving works. Oo
note are: Confessions (see above), On the Trinity, City of God, exegetcal works, works against
Pelagius and against the Donatsts.
Augustne is a Christan Patristc author oo the eestern Church, so wrote in Latn.
Brief Biography
eas born to a Christan mother (Monica) and a pagan oather (Patricius) in Thagaste (in present-day
Algeria). As a child, he was admited as a Christan catechumen, but not baptsed. e was educated
in rhetoric – prepared oor a career oo public/civil responsibility. At university in Carthage, he
abandoned his Christanity and took up Manichaeism.
Manichaeism: After the Persian teacher Mani (c. 21h6 – 276) – with roots in Zoroastrianism and
Persian oolk religion. It was a radically dualisti religion: evil exists because God’s goodness is
opposed by an entrely separate evil divine entty. The frst human beings, Adam and Eve, were
created by this evil spiritual entty. uman beings become a batleground between the oorces oo
good and evil: we can either oollow the good God, or be agents oo evil oorces – this is played out in
both individual and global terms. As a newer religion than Christanity, Manichaeism took on
various oeatures oo church organisaton orom Christanity.
It seems as though in his twentes, Augustne was an efectve advocate oor Manichaeism, winning
a number oo his peers over to the oaith. After teaching rhetoric in Carthage, he moved orom his
natve Aorica to Rome in 3r3, during which he seems to have become disenchanted by the oaith.
is interest moved to Neoplatonism. During this period, he also took a mistress by whom he had
a son.
Neoplatonism: a oorm oo Platonism which emerged in the Christan Era (though not expressly
Christan). Key thinkers: Plotnus (c. 205 – c. 270) and Porphyry (c. 233 – c. 309). Focus on the One
(as an expression oo Platonic monotheism) as the Source and End oo all being. From the One derive
all other beings through the Nous or Demiurge. The ooundaton oo creaton is Spiritual, which is
then expressed in phenomenal terms. In human terms, these correspond frst to the human soul
and thence to the physical body. This is close enough to certain expressions oo Christanity to make
it ‘not exactly incompatble with’ a lot oo patristc thought. It was no surprise that a number oo
neo-platonists were drawn to patristc Christanity, including Augustne, and that neoplatonism
should exert an interpretatve infuence on Christan theological philosophy.
After just a year in Rome, Augustne moved to become the prooessor oo rhetoric to the Imperial
Court in Milan. Beoorehand, however, under the infuence oo his mother, Augustne dismissed his
mistress and their son.ehile at Milan, he became infuenced by its bishop, Ambrose of Milan (c. 340 – 397). Ambrose
was an outstanding intellectual and it was Ambrose’s intellectual approach, which allowed him to
engage Augustne and others in philosophical discourse, together with Ambrose’s use oo allegory
to interpret the Old Testament, which helped to turn Augustne back to Christanity. Augustne’s
intellectual deoenses were beaten, but he prevaricated untl, while in a garden in Milan, he
overheard children chantng ‘take up and read, take up and read’. e was studying Paul’s epistle to
the Romans, and so he ‘took up and read’ the passage beoore him, Romans 1h3:1h2 – 1h4: The night is
far gone, the day is at hand. Let us then lay aside the works of darkness and put on the armour of
light; let us live honourably as in the day, not in revelling or drunkenness, not in debauihery and
liientousness, not in quarrelling and jealousy. Instead, put on the Lord eesus Christ and make no
provision for the fesh.
Augustne was baptsed by Ambrose in 3r7. e returned to Aorica, to the oamily home in ippo. In
391h he was ordained priest and quickly became oamous oor his preaching (remember, he was a
teacher oo rhetoric). In 395 he was made bishop and remained at ippo untl his death in 430.
Key themes and Works
Writings against thne Donnatists
See previous lecture on Persecuton and the issue oo schism in North Aorica. The Donatsts had split
orom the mainstream church over the issue oo rebaptsm oo heretcs and schismatcs. From the
Donatst point oo view, the oly Spirit only is oound inside the true Church. Thereoore, the rites and
sacraments oo heretcal or schismatc ‘churches’ do not have any efect, as a heretcal or schismatc
bishop does not possess the gift oo the Spirit required oor a sacrament oo baptsm to be efectve.
Ironically, the Donatsts ‘split’ on this issue orom the practce oo the wider Church.
The Donatsts were partcularly successoul in Aorica, because their practce oo rebaptsing
schismatcs and heretcs conoormed to the teaching oo Cyprian of Cathage (see earlier lecture).
Cyprian had stated ‘outside the Church there is no salvaton’, and had commended rebaptsm oo
heretcs and schismatcs. Cyprian was commended as a martyr by both Donatsts and Catholics
alike, so Augustne had to step careoully in arguing against a practce Cyprian himselo had
commended. Nevertheless, whatever Cyprian may have said, the wider Church outside Aorica
tended not to rebaptse those who had been baptsed by schismatcal groups and had a variable
policy in regard to heretcal baptsm. Augustne, as bishop oo the Catholic Church in Aorica, needed
to deoend his positon theologically whilst honouring the memory oo Cyprian.
Augustne argued that sacraments (like baptsm and the eucharist) had two parts: an inward
(spiritual) part and an outward (visible) part – ie. the rite itselo. It was possible to have the outward
part, without possessing the inward benefts. In the case oo a schismatc baptsm, those baptsed
did genuinely get ‘outwardly’ baptsed, but were not in possession oo baptsm’s spiritual benefts
(oorgiveness oo sins, new birth) because oo the sin oo schism in which the rite took part. For
Augustne, the biggest sin oo schismatcs was the failure to love, in that they stood apart orom the
rest oo the Church by separatng themselves of orom them. Since love is the ‘frst commandment’
this was a serious sin, and the root problem in schismatc groups.
The second part oo Augustne’s argument was that sacraments work by virtue oo Jesus’
righteousness, not by the righteousness oo the person administering the sacrament. But
schismatcs, by separatng themselves orom their brothers and sisters, also separated themselves
orom Christ himselo. It was this which nullifed the inward power oo their sacraments, not merely
that they were administered by ‘the wrong oranchise’.The conclusion oo Augustne’s argument was that the answer to the problem was oor the candidate
to re-unite themselves to Christ by returning into oellowship with the rest oo the Church. This re-
established the love connecton, and the inward benefts – which always relied on Christ’s
righteousness – made their baptsm valid and efectve inwardly as well as outwardly. Augustne
had succeeded in providing a theological justfcaton oor the widespread practce oo Catholic
Christanity! owever, this emphasis on love did not stop him later using the law to persecute
Donatsts in Aorica, as bishop oo the Empire-sponsored (Catholic) oaith!
Augustine versus eeaagius
Pelagius was a Celtc priest, who was shocked by hearing a reading oo Augustne’s Confessions.
Augustne was vehement in ascribing to grace (and grace alone) the reason oor conversion. For
Pelagius, this nullifed any human responsibility oor salvaton, good works and the need to obey
God. It is arguable that Pelagius’ positon was closer to the Church’s liturgy than Augustne’s more
abstract theology oo grace. As the debate between the two deepened, various polarites emerged:
• Pelagius believed that all humans are born innocent and have exercise oo oree will to choose
God’s will;
• Augustne believed that all humans are born sinoul and their will is damaged by sin so they
cannot choose God’s will and be saved;
• Pelagius believed the journey to salvaton involved an actve doing oo good works as part oo
the process towards becoming a Christan and resultng salvaton (through baptsm);
• Augustne believed the journey to salvaton depended uterly on grace alone, and was
totally a gift orom God, without reoerence to any goodness within the convert;
• Pelagius believed that human beings had an actve part to play over whether they received
God’s grace or not – ie. they could choose whether to be saved or not;
• Augustne believed that God had predestned a subset oo humanity to be saved and to
these, and these alone, he gave grace which led inevitably to their salvaton through
conversion and baptsm; the rest oo humanity had been elected by God not to be saved but
to die as sinners
Along with the rest oo the Church oo the tme, both Augustne and Pelagius regarded baptsm as
the principal channel to receiving Christ and salvaton. owever, since Augustne taught that even
a new-born inoant was a sinner in need oo redempton, his teaching accelerated the take-up oo
infant baptsm with a renewed sense oo urgency and necessity, since unbaptsed inoants had no
hope oo salvaton.
ehy did Augustne believe even new-born inoants were sinners in need oo redempton, when they
had not commited actual sin oo their own? is answer is that at concepton all human beings
inherit the sin oo Adam – original sin – orom their parents and that this is passed on because no act
oo procreatve sex (by the parents) is entrely oree oo the sin oo lust. All humanity is, oor Augustne,
naturally a lump oo sin – some scholars argue that this refects a return to his earlier attudes
when he was a Manichaean.
City onf Gond
This book was triggered by the sack oo Rome by invading Visigoths. Sought to explain why the
Christan Empire was less stable to collapse than the old Pagan empire had been. Augustne, in the
book lays out an interpretaton oo all oo history as a batle between the ‘City oo God’ and the ‘Cityoo Man’. e distnguishes between these two cites in present history as well as past: thereoore,
just because the Empire is now Christan does not imply that it is equal to the City oo God. Sin can
stll cause the Empire to crumble, but the City oo God will never crumble – it will triumph. This
helps avoid a simplistc assumpton that because an empire (or country) is ruled by a Christan, that
that country will act any beter or oare any beter than a pagan empire or country. istory, oor
Augustne, is a spiritual struggle, where the politcs don’t necessarily correspond to the spiritual
world.
By implicaton, the present Church as we ian perieive it (ie. the Visible Church) is not the City oo
God either, as it may contain within itselo sinners and hypocrites. Only in the fnal, heavenly City, at
the end oo history will the saved and purifed Church be equal to the City oo God. This was
important reassurance oor Christans oo the eestern (Latn) Church in the midst oo the crumbling
eestern Empire. The Eastern Empire did not oully collapse untl the oall oo Constantnople in 1h453.
Thus Augustne’s work diferentated between the Visible and the Invisible Church, the Church
Militant (on earth, stll struggling) and the Church Triumphant (in heaven, victorious at the end oo
tme).
Thne Trinity
ee have seen in the previous session how the Councils struggled with terminology (Greek) in
defning the nature oo the Christan God as Trinity. Augustne’s writng on the Trinity (De Trinitate)
some tme after the Council oo Constantnople (3r1h) marks a move away orom the politcs oo the
councils, with their prooos orom salvaton history, towards a more philosophical approach.
Augustne’s De Trinitate provides a oundamental way oo understanding how God can be One and
yet Three. e uses the Biblical asserton that God is love to describe, by way oo analogy, how the
diferent persons oo the godhead can be one, yet relate in that oneness oo love. But Augustne, in
providing a justfcaton oor Trinitarian language, goes on to relate the doctrine to the need oor
reconciliaton to God (and hence oor the need oor salvaton) and also to provide a basis oor
understanding the nature oo our humanity and hence to provide an interpretatve oramework oor
spiritual growth.
The work demonstrates the sophistcaton and power oo Augustne as a philosopher, and provided
that basis oor philosophical theology in eestern thought oor centuries to come.
