* An approach
  - 

* diverse views 
  - over time and 
  - over place

## Holy Scripture

* What is Scripture
  - 66 books + ?
  - inspired/revealed word of God, written by people
  - a guide
  - a gift
  - points to God, not to itself

* Is the Bible (after Henry Newman)
  - equivalent to the very word of God
  - a divine seed from which we anticipate growth
  - a muse leading to piety
  - liberative paradigms (!)

* topics of concern
  - production
  - canon (66+books)
  - authority (the / a / all equal / ?)
  - interpretation (how to adjudicate between different ones)
    - apartied / anti-semitism / etc
    - cannot even take refuge in the  traditional view as church has 

* 3 historical approachces and then a dogmatic view

## Early and patristic (AD 100-451)

* reliant on tradition and stories but now re-orientated to Christ
  - epitomised by 2 Timothy 3:16-17 (Scrpture here is Hebrw Scritptures / OT)
  - Luke 24:27: Christ is the fulflment of the Scriptuures (but would be nice to have that exposition written down!!)
  
> Quote from System Theology, Robert Jenson

* There is no church without the apostles and no apostles without Israel's scriptures
  - significant in dealing with Marcion in 2nd C who wrote OT ought and Justin Martyr's response who rebutted it.
  - also Iranaeus of Lyon: _More_ but _not different_ to OT

* Letters of Paul earliest but gospels ('memoirs of apostles' according to Justin Martyr) have greatest significance and honour
  - Authority is not being 'the definitive' account--four were canonised
  - Authority of gospels derives from proximity to apostles (and therefore Christ) 

* Jesus is key
  - https://www.bible.com/en-GB/bible/111/1CO.7.NIVUK[1 Cor 7] Paul is clear to separate what he says and what Christ said.

> Against heresies, Bk IV, ch 26.1, Iranaeus

> Contra Celsus, Origen

* Athanasius, 4th C
  - In his Festal Letter of 367
  - A first canon, not his opinion but those already recognised
  - What matters is Christ's example as well as his teaching and what was written down

> In these [books] alone is proclaimed the doctrine of godliness. Let no man add to these, neither let him take ought from these.

* Bible's connection to the church
  - Starting to recognise that appeal to Scripture alone may not be enough (that is where Arius et al. did to justify that Jesus was a creature).

* Vincent of Lerins (French monk died c.445)
  - Quite forcefully

> Commonitory ch 25

## Reformation and post-reformation

* Huge explosion of reflection on what Scripture is.

  - _sola scriptura_ - scripture as the final authority (clarifying creeds, traditions etc.) 
  - _autopista_ - scripture is self-authenticating

* Martin Luther
  - Testimony at Diet of Worms: Scripture not Popes, 'cos they erred and self-contradicted

> Luther's Works Vol 32, p112

* John Calvin
  - God (as Holy Spirit) is the proof of Scripture

> Institutes 1.vii.5

* Frances Turretin, Italian pastor (1623-1687)
  - adds precision to how Holy Spirit underpins / authenitcates Scripture 
  
> The biblical authors wrote by means of 'immediate inspiration and the internal impulse of the Holy Spirit'
Inst. 1, p60

* Aside
  - Cappadocian fathers predicted the problem of splitering because there is no way to arbitrate between different interpretations of scipture.  
  - Post Vatican 2, Catholics have come back to Scriptures as a foundational principle

Plenty of room to develop in assignments!

## The modern era 

The historio-critical method

Measuring scripture against natural reason--as one would critique any other book--as opposed to being a community of faith.

* Baruch Spinoza, Dutch philosopher (1632-1677)
  - 'free our minds from theological prejudices'
  - external perspective: can only be esteemed insofaras it meets test of natural reason
    - so miracles are counter to natural experience so must be fictitious
  - scripture is important to Christians as it connects them to their roots
  - some useful techniques here but not a faith community

> Theological--Political treatise, pp98-100,111

* 19th C German universities became powerfully associated with this modern approach

* Charles Hodge, Prof at Princeton (1797-1878)
  - Others, notable Princeton, engaged to rebute this leading to _Biblical infallibility_.

* Most UK institutions opted for historio-critical approach

* Karl Barth, Swiss theologian (1886-1968)
  - Trained in the liberal, modern tradition but turned against it
  - 1916, 'The strange new world of the Bible'
  - first book is commentary on epistle to the Romans
  - went on to write 'Church dogmatics', a vast work of systematic theology
  - careful not to idolise the word of God, scripture is revelation of God

> The word of God and the word of man, p43

* John Webster: Sanctification
  - Seeking to balance creaturely nature of text (written by people) but inspired by God
  - inspirationalists go too far by denying the creaturely nature of the text
  - modernists go too far to deny the divine
