## Gregory Nazianzus--The First Theological Oration

### Introduction

Gregory of Nazianzus (c.329-c.390) was a fourth century theologian who, along with
the other so-called 'Cappadocian Fathers' (Basil of Caesarea and Gregory of Nyssa)
played a large part in the theological settlement represented in the Council of
Constantinople in 381 (which produced the final form of the Nicene Creed). In the
years leading up to the Council, Gregory preached what have become known as the
the five 'Theological Orations' in defence of the divinity of the Son, and chiefly
against a group of heretics known as the Eunomians. The first oration is notable for
its development of the following themes:
1. The portrayal of heretics as those who indulge in theological debate merely
for 'sport' or amusement.
2. The purity of one's heart as a prerequisite for doing theology.
3. The need for 'restraining one's tongue' when it comes to speaking of the
divine mysteries.
4. The belief that theology should be protected from becoming too 'common.'
5. The insistence that the agenda for theology should be set by its own subject
matter (i.e., God) rather than by debates with opponents.
6. The plea for those interested in simply debating to focus on any subject other
than God—since talking about God must always be, in a certain sense,
'dangerous.'

A Preliminary Discourse Against the Eunomians

1. am to speak against persons who pride themselves on their eloquence; so, to begin
with a text of Scripture, Behold, I am against you, O thou proud one, Jeremiah 50:31
not only in your system of teaching, but also in your hearing, and in your tone of
mind. For there are certain persons who have not only their ears 2 Timothy 4:3 and
their tongues, but even, as I now perceive, their hands too, itching for our words; who
delight in profane babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called, and strifes
about words, which tend to no profit; for so Paul, the Preacher and Establisher of the
Word cut short, Romans 9:28 the disciple and teacher of the Fishermen, calls all that
is excessive or superfluous in discourse. But as to those to whom we refer, would that
they, whose tongue is so voluble and clever in applying itself to noble and approved
language, would likewise pay some attention to actions. For then perhaps in a little
while they would become less sophistical, and less absurd and strange acrobats of
words, if I may use a ridiculous expression about a ridiculous subject.

2. But since they neglect every path of righteousness, and look only to this one point,
namely, which of the propositions submitted to them they shall bind or loose, (like
those persons who in the theatres perform wrestling matches in public, but not that
kind of wrestling in which the victory is won according to the rules of the sport, but a
kind to deceive the eyes of those who are ignorant in such matters, and to catch
applause), and every marketplace must buzz with their talking; and every dinner party
be worried to death with silly talk and boredom; and every festival be made unfestive
and full of dejection, and every occasion of mourning be consoled by a greater
calamity — their questions— and all the women's apartments accustomed to
simplicity be thrown into confusion and be robbed of its flower of modesty by the
torrent of their words...since, I say this is so, the evil is intolerable and not to be
borne, and our Great Mystery is in danger of being made a thing of little moment.
Well then, let these spies bear with us, moved as we are with fatherly compassion,
and as holy Jeremiah says, torn in our hearts; Jeremiah 4:19 let them bear with us so
far as not to give a savage reception to our discourse upon this subject; and let them,
if indeed they can, restrain their tongues for a short while and lend us their ears.
However that may be, you shall at any rate suffer no loss. For either we shall have
spoken in the ears of them that will hear, Sirach 25:9 and our words will bear some
fruit, namely an advantage to you (since the Sower sows the Word upon every kind of
mind; and the good and fertile bears fruit), or else you will depart despising this
discourse of ours as you have despised others, and having drawn from it further
material for gainsaying and railing at us, upon which to feast yourselves yet more.
And you must not be astonished if I speak a language which is strange to you and
contrary to your custom, who profess to know everything and to teach everything in a
too impetuous and generous manner...not to pain you by saying ignorant and rash.

3. Not to every one, my friends, does it belong to philosophize about God; not to
every one; the Subject is not so cheap and low; and I will add, not before every
audience, nor at all times, nor on all points; but on certain occasions, and before
certain persons, and within certain limits.
Not to all men, because it is permitted only to those who have been examined, and are
passed masters in meditation, and who have been previously purified in soul and
body, or at the very least are being purified. For the impure to touch the pure is, we
may safely say, not safe, just as it is unsafe to fix weak eyes upon the sun's rays. And
what is the permitted occasion? It is when we are free from all external defilement or
disturbance, and when that which rules within us is not confused with vexatious or
erring images; like persons mixing up good writing with bad, or filth with the sweet
odours of ointments. For it is necessary to be truly at leisure to know God; and when
we can get a convenient season, to discern the straight road of the things divine. And
who are the permitted persons? They to whom the subject is of real concern, and not
they who make it a matter of pleasant gossip, like any other thing, after the races, or
the theatre, or a concert, or a dinner, or still lower employments. To such men as
these, idle jests and pretty contradictions about these subjects are a part of their
amusement.

4. Next, on what subjects and to what extent may we philosophize? On matters
within our reach, and to such an extent as the mental power and grasp of our audience
may extend. No further, lest, as excessively loud sounds injure the hearing, or excess
of food the body, or, if you will, as excessive burdens beyond the strength injure those
who bear them, or excessive rains the earth; so these too, being pressed down and
overweighted by the stiffness, if I may use the expression, of the arguments should
suffer loss even in respect of the strength they originally possessed.

5. Now, I am not saying that it is not needful to remember God at all times;...] must
not be misunderstood, or I shall be having these nimble and quick people down upon
me again. For we ought to think of God even more often than we draw our breath; and
if the expression is permissible, we ought to do nothing else. Yea, I am one of those
who entirely approve that Word which bids us meditate day and night, and tell at
eventide and morning and noon day, and praise the Lord at every time; or, to use
Moses' words, whether a man lie down, or rise up, or walk by the way, or whatever
else he be doing Deuteronomy 6:7 — and by this recollection we are to be moulded to
purity. So that it is not the continual remembrance of God that I would hinder, but
only the talking about God; nor even that as in itself wrong, but only when
unseasonable; nor all teaching, but only want of moderation. As of even honey
repletion and satiety, though it be of honey, produce vomiting; Proverbs 25:16 and, as
Solomon says and I think, there is a time for every thing, Ecclesiastes 3:1 and that
which is good ceases to be good if it be not done in a good way; just as a flower is
quite out of season in winter, and just as a man's dress does not become a woman, nor
a woman's a man; and as geometry is out of place in mourning, or tears at a carousal;
shall we in this instance alone disregard the proper time, in a matter in which most of
all due season should be respected? Surely not, my friends and brethren (for I will still
call you Brethren, though you do not behave like brothers). Let us not think so nor
yet, like hot tempered and hard mouthed horses, throwing off our rider Reason, and
casting away Reverence, that keeps us within due limits, run far away from the
turning point, but let us philosophize within our proper bounds, and not be carried
away into Egypt, nor be swept down into Assyria Daniel 3:12, nor sing the Lord's
song in a strange land, by which I mean before any kind of audience, strangers or
kindred, hostile or friendly, kindly or the reverse, who watch what we do with over
great care, and would like the spark of what is wrong in us to become a flame, and
secretly kindle and fan it and raise it to heaven with their breath and make it higher
than the Babylonian flame which burnt up every thing around it. For since their
strength lies not in their own dogmas, they hunt for it in our weak points. And
therefore they apply themselves to our— shall I say misfortunes or failings?— like
flies to wounds. But let us at least be no longer ignorant of ourselves, or pay too little
attention to the due order in these matters. And if it be impossible to put an end to the
existing hostility, let us at least agree upon this, that we will utter Mysteries under our
breath, and holy things in a holy manner, and we will not cast to ears profane that
which may not be uttered, nor give evidence that we possess less gravity than those
who worship demons, and serve shameful fables and deeds; for they would sooner
give their blood to the uninitiated than certain words. But let us recognize that as in
dress and diet and laughter and demeanour there is a certain decorum, so there is also
in speech and silence; since among so many titles and powers of God, we pay the
highest honour to The Word. Let even our disputings then be kept within bounds.

6. Why should a man who is a hostile listener to such words be allowed to hear
about the Generation of God, or his creation, or how God was made out of things
which had no existence, or of section and analysis and division? Why do we make our
accusers judges? Why do we put swords into the hands of our enemies? How, do you
think, or with what temper, will the arguments about such subjects be received by one
who approves of adulteries, and corruption of children, and who worships the
passions and cannot conceive of anything higher than the body...who till very lately
set up gods for himself, and gods too who were noted for the vilest deeds? Will it not
first be from a material standpoint, shamefully and ignorantly, and in the sense to
which he has been accustomed? Will he not make your Theology a defence for his
own gods and passions? For if we ourselves wantonly misuse these words, it will be a
long time before we shall persuade them to accept our philosophy. And if they are in
their own persons inventors of evil things, how should they refrain from grasping at
such things when offered to them? Such results come to us from mutual contest. Such
results follow to those who fight for the Word beyond what the Word approves; they
are behaving like mad people, who set their own house on fire, or tear their own
children, or disavow their own parents, taking them for strangers.

7. But when we have put away from the conversation those who are strangers to it,
and sent the great legion Luke 8:31 on its way to the abyss into the herd of swine, the
next thing is to look to ourselves, and polish our theological self to beauty like a
statue. The first point to be considered is— What is this great rivalry of speech and
endless talking? What is this new disease of insatiability? Why have we tied our
hands and armed our tongues? We do not praise either hospitality, or brotherly love,
or conjugal affection, or virginity; nor do we admire liberality to the poor, or the
chanting of Psalms, or nightlong vigils, or tears. We do not keep under the body by
fasting, or go forth to God by prayer; nor do we subject the worse to the better— I
mean the dust to the spirit— as they would do who form a just judgment of our
composite nature; we do not make our life a preparation for death; nor do we make
ourselves masters of our passions, mindful of our heavenly nobility; nor tame our
anger when it swells and rages, nor our pride that brings to a fall, nor unreasonable
grief, nor unchastened pleasure, nor meretricious laughter, nor undisciplined eyes, nor
insatiable ears, nor excessive talk, nor absurd thoughts, nor anything of the occasions
which the Evil One gets against us from sources within ourselves; bringing upon us
the death that comes through the windows, Jeremiah 9:21 as Holy Scripture says; that
is, through the senses. Nay we do the very opposite, and have given liberty to the
passions of others, as kings give releases from service in honour of a victory, only on
condition that they incline to our side, and make their assault upon God more boldly,
or more impiously. And we give them an evil reward for a thing which is not good,
license of tongue for their impiety.

8. And yet, O talkative Dialectician, I will ask you one small question, Job 38:3
and answer thou me, as He says to Job, Who through whirlwind and cloud gives
Divine admonitions. Job 38:1 Are there many mansions in God's House, as you have
heard, or only one? Of course you will admit that there are many, and not only one.
Now, are they all to be filled, or only some, and others not; so that some will be left
empty, and will have been prepared to no purpose? Of course all will be filled, for
nothing can be in vain which has been done by God. And can you tell me what you
will consider this Mansion to be? Is it the rest and glory which is in store There for
the Blessed, or something else?— No, not anything else. Since then we are agreed
upon this point, let us further examine another also. Is there any thing that procures
these Mansions, as I think there is; or is there nothing?— Certainly there is— What is
it? Is it not that there are various modes of conduct, and various purposes, one leading
one way, another another way, according to the proportion of faith, and these we call
Ways? Must we, then, travel all, or some of these Ways...the same individual along
them all, if that be possible; or, if not, along as many as may be; or else along some of
them? And even if this may not be, it would still be a great thing, at least as it appears
to me, to travel excellently along even one.— You are right in your conception.—
What then when you hear there is but One way, and that a narrow one, Matthew 7:14
does the word seem to you to show? That there is but one on account of its
excellence. For it is but one, even though it be split into many parts. And narrow
because of its difficulties, and because it is trodden by few in comparison with the
multitude of the adversaries, and of those who travel along the road of wickedness. So
I think too. Well, then, my good friend, since this is so, why do you, as though
condemning our doctrine for a certain poverty, rush headlong down that one which
leads through what you call arguments and speculations, but I frivolities and
quackeries? Let Paul reprove you with those bitter reproaches, in which, after his list
of the Gifts of Grace, he says, Are all Apostles? Are all Prophets? Etc. 1 Corinthians
12:29

9. But, be it so. Lofty you are, even beyond the lofty, even above the clouds, if you
will, a spectator of things invisible, a hearer of things unspeakable; one who hast
ascended after Elias, and who after Moses hast been deemed worthy of the Vision of
God, and after Paul hast been taken up into heaven; why do you mould the rest of
your fellows in one day into Saints, and ordain them Theologians, and as it were
breathe into them instruction, and make them many councils of ignorant oracles? Why
do you entangle those who are weaker in your spider's web, if it were something great
and wise? Why do you stir up wasps' nests against the Faith? Why do you suddenly
spring a flood of dialectics upon us, as the fables of old did the Giants? Why have you
collected all that is frivolous and unmanly among men, like a rabble, into one torrent,
and having made them more effeminate by flattery, fashioned a new workshop,
cleverly making a harvest for yourself out of their want of understanding? Do you
deny that this is so, and are the other matters of no account to you? Must your tongue
tule at any cost, and can you not restrain the birthpang of your speech? You may find
many other honourable subjects for discussion. To these turn this disease of yours
with some advantage. Attack the silence of Pythagoras, and the Orphic beans, and the
novel brag about The Master said. Attack the ideas of Plato, and the transmigrations
and courses of our souls, and the reminiscences, and the unlovely loves of the soul for
lovely bodies. Attack the atheism of Epicurus, and his atoms, and his unphilosophic
pleasure; or Aristotle's petty Providence, and his artificial system, and his discourses
about the mortality of the soul, and the humanitarianism of his doctrine. Attack the
superciliousness of the Stoa, or the greed and vulgarity of the Cynic. Attack the Void
and Full (what nonsense), and all the details about the gods and the sacrifices and the
idols and demons, whether beneficent or malignant, and all the tricks that people play
with divination, evoking of gods, or of souls, and the power of the stars. And if these
things seem to you unworthy of discussion as petty and already often confuted, and
you will keep to your line, and seek the satisfaction of your ambition in it; then here
too I will provide you with broad paths. Philosophize about the world or worlds;
about matter; about soul; about natures endowed with reason, good or bad; about
resurrection, about judgment, about reward, or the Sufferings of Christ. For in these
subjects to hit the mark is not useless, and to miss it is not dangerous. But with God
we shall have converse, in this life only in a small degree; but a little later, it may be,
more perfectly, in the Same, our Lord Jesus Christ, to Whom be glory for ever. Amen.
