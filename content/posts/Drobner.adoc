## II. THE “THREE GREAT CAPPADOCIANS”

### Introduction: Their Families and Joint Significance

Because of their extraordinary importance for theology and the church,
Basil the Great, his younger brother Gregory of Nyssa, and his fellow student
Gregory of Nazianzus were given the honorary title “the three great Cappadocians.” They were part of a newly emerging stratum of ecclesiastical leadership,
or one that came to the fore more prominently in the course of the fourth century, after the so-called Constantinian shift. They were drawn from families that not only had already been part of the Christian faith for generations but also had
actively contributed to the shaping of ecclesiastical life. They belonged to the
prosperous and influential upper strata of society and, commensurate with this,
had enjoyed an excellent education, which predestined them to engage in the
standard public careers of rhetor, lawyer, or statesman.

The grandfather, on the mother’s side, of the two brothers, Basil and
Gregory, had suffered martyrdom during the Diocletian persecution. Their
grandmother on the father’s side, St. Macrina the Elder, was a student of Gregory
Thaumaturgus, the famous bishop of Neocaesarea, to whom her nephew, Gregory
of Nyssa (presumably named after him) left a memorial in a sermon. During the
persecution, she and her husband had to flee into the mountains for seven years.
As a wealthy landowner, her husband, St. Basil the Elder, was part of the senatorial nobility. Her mother, St. Emmelia, also came from a wealthy Cappadocian
family; her brother was a bishop. Besides Basil and Gregory, another three of the
ten siblings devoted themselves to the ecclesiastical or ascetic life: their oldest sister, St. Macrina the Younger, who had an enduring influence upon her brothers’
lives; Naucratius, who died in his younger years; and St. Peter, their youngest
brother, who was bishop of Sebaste.

The family of Gregory of Nazianzus likewise had been Christian for three
generations on his mother’s side. She owned estates in nearby Arianzus, and
Gregory’s father, St. Gregory the elder, had preceded him as bishop of Nazianzus.
The church also venerates his mother, Nonna, as well as two of his three siblings,
Gorgonia and Caesarius, as saints. His cousin, St. Amphilochius, became bishop
of Iconium and is considered by many to be the “fourth great Cappadocian.”

All three of the “great Cappadocians” turned their backs on their secular
careers, not intending to exchange them for ecclesiastical ones but, rather, to devote themselves to an ascetic life of solitariness in the radical following of Christ.
All three, however, were called to the episcopal office because, on the basis of their
background and education, they possessed the qualifications not only for political
but also for ecclesiastical leadership, especially considering that, beginning with
the second half of the fourth century, bishops increasingly also assumed public,
administrative roles. All three of them gained their individually shaped importance: Basil as an outstanding ecclesiastical politician, Gregory of Nazianzus as a rhetor and theologian, and Gregory of Nyssa more as a philosophical thinker.
The first two, together with Athanasius and John Chrysostom, have been reckoned among the “four great teachers of the Eastern church” since the Breviary of
Pius V in 1568 and, together with Athanasius, are revered as the “three hierarchs”
for their pioneering work on the Trinitarian dogma. By contrast, Gregory of
Nyssa is somewhat of an outsider.

That the Cappadocians do not represent a regional phenomenon in the recruitment of leadership personalities in the church of the time can be seen in the
Western church from the family of Ambrose, bishop of Milan, as well as Augustine
and his mother, St. Monica, who attracted a circle of friends in the spirit of monasticism, which ultimately became a major source for the North African episcopate.

### A. Basil the Great

The details of the chronology of Basil’s life, to whom was already attributed.
the title “the Great” during his lifetime, cannot be precisely determined in all its
parts, and it is currently being discussed once again. He was born ca. 329/330 as
[#page-268]
the eldest son(?)footnote:[According to W.-D. Hauschild (TRE 5:302), contra J. Gribomont (EECh 1:114 and
miscne F . wanes weet Was Kawa covene on] of ten siblings and initially was taught in the classical disciplines by his father, whereas he received his instruction in the Christian faith
from his grandmother Macrina. As a student of Gregory Thaumaturgus, she embedded (Origen’s) Alexandrian theology in him. In keeping with the current custom of delaying baptism until adulthood, he did not receive baptism. After
attending the school of rhetors at Caesarea (beginning in 343?), where he first
met Gregory of Nazianzus, he sought out the most famous teachers and places
of training, in keeping with his family’s status and financial ability. In Constantinople he was with Libanius (346-350?), with whom he later corresponded (Ep.
335-359); at the academy in Athens he heard the famous rhetors Prohairesius
and Himerius, became acquainted with Julian, the later emperor, and met
Gregory of Nazianzus again, with whom he enjoyed a lifelong friendship from
this point on and whose life he was to influence significantly, both spiritually and
in matters of ecclesiastical politics. After his return from Athens (3562), he briefly
taught rhetoric in Caesarea, but he relinquished this occupation and devoted
himself fully to a radical Christian, ascetic lifestyle. He was baptized, became a
lector, sold all of his possessions, and used the proceeds to fund the support of the
poor. The welfare of the “lowly person,” especially in the context of contacts with
the authorities, was to remain one of his primary concerns and areas of engagement throughout his life.

After his educational travels to study in the monastic centers in Syria, Mesopotamia, Palestine, and Egypt, he settled on one of the family estates called Annesi,
on the river Iris in the province of Pontus, together with Emmelia, his mother;
Macrina, his sister; and Naucratius, his brother. There a monastic community
gathered around him, serving as a model for the founding of future communities.
He also developed there his ascetic program and wrote the first two rules laying
the foundation for his work as the “father of Eastern monasticism” (cf. ch. 8.1.B).
Together with Gregory of Nazianzus, he compiled the _Philocalia_, an anthology of
Origen’s writings, at this time. For the reasons outlined in the introduction, it was
not to be Basil’s lot to conclude his life in monastic seclusion, all the more so
since, from 364 on, both the Nicene and the Homoiousian churches were increasingly pressured by Emperor Valens’s Homoean religious policy (cf. part 3.I.D).
These churches urgently needed highly qualified and influential church leaders,
and so in 364 Basil yielded to his friends’ urging and was ordained a priest in
Cappadocian Caesarea. In 359/360 he had already participated in a synod in Constantinople, but later on he had a falling out with Eusebius, bishop of Caesarea,
and returned to solitude.

According to his theological conviction, Basil at that time belonged to the
Homoiousians, who were inclined toward the Nicene position but strictly rejected the emperor’s Homoean confession. Already when he was a presbyter, he
assumed in practice the leadership of the bishopric because Bishop Eusebius was
[#page-269, Apollinarianism and the Second Phase of Arianism]
hardly up to the extremely difficult ecclesiastical-political situation. At the same
time, he also began to pursue the two goals that were to determine the rest of his
life: combating the Homoean policy of the state, and the reunification of the
Eastern (Homoiousian) churches with Nicea and Rome. This was the purpose of
the synods in Lampsacus (364) and Tyana (366), as well as of the resistance
against Valens (365) by the city of Caesarea.

In the fall of 370 he succeeded Eusebius as bishop of Caesarea, which at the
same time also made him metropolitan of the ecclesiastical province of Cappadocia and exarch of the political diocese of Pontus. The authorities, who had
already opposed his election because of his public anti-Homoean position, continued their pursuit to force him to align himself with them, in 372 even with the
personal efforts of Emperor Valens, albeit without success. On the basis of a panegyric by Gregory of Nazianzus (_Or. Bas._ 43.46-53), this hagiographically noted
resistance by Basil was brought to the emperor’s attention and cannot be denied
as historical fact. It may have to be evaluated, however, in a completely different
way, for Valens not only did not depose Basil but also in 372/373 assigned him to
avisitation to Armenia. This cannot be explained on the grounds of Basil’s social
and politically powerful position alone but suggests a correspondingly high regard and goodwill on the part of the emperor. In 372 Basil did indeed have to accept a painful shrinking of his ecclesiastical province because of the division of
the province of Cappadocia, but he responded by increasing the bishoprics and
appointing brothers, relatives, and friends to be bishops (Gregory of Nazianzus in
Sasima, his brother Gregory in Nyssa, and Amphilochius in Iconium).

Especially after the death of Athanasius (373), his main concern continued to be the strengthening of ecclesiastical communion with Rome, particularly by ending the Antiochene schism. Even if he was not entirely successful
in these endeavors by the time he died on January 1, 379,footnote:[P.Maraval, "La date de la mort de Basile de Césarée," REAug3A.(1988) proposes August 377, agreed to by Roder 65 (cf bibliography on II'B'1); Pouchet: September 37?)] he nevertheless contributed substantially, in the few years of his episcopate, as an outstanding and
renowned leader of the Cappadocian church and far beyond, to the theological
and ecclesiastical-political solution that emerged immediately after his death,
because of the death of Valens (August 9, 378) and the assumption of power by
Emperor Theodosius (January 19, 379)footnote:[Maraval, “La date de la mort de Basile de Césarée,” REAug 34 (1988): 25-38, proposes August 377, agreed to by Réder 65 (cf. bibliography on II.B.1); Pouchet: September 37?].

Basil has left behind an extensive wealth of writings, which is worth knowing as a whole. These works are consistently focused on practical ecclesiastical life
and reflect his own life and work: the famous __Ad adolescentes__, to the young on
how they may benefit from Hellenistic literature; several (exegetical) homilies
and letters; his rules on ascetic life; and his two major dogmatic treatises, against
Eunomius and on the Holy Spirit. The so-called liturgy of Basil, the current form
of which originated in the sixth century, at its core goes back to his reforms of
Caesarea’s liturgy.

### 1. Contra Eunomium

In his __Apologia__, written in 360/361, Eunomius of Cyzicus had justified and
defended his anomoean theology of the Trinity. Basil probably came upon this

[#page-272]

very persuasive and hence dangerous work quite early and realized the necessity
of a careful response, which he provided in 363/364 in __Contra Eunomium__, composed of three books (the so-called fourth and fifth books are not Basil’s). Each of
the three books deals with one person of the Trinity; Basil’s method was to go
through Eunomius’s text meticulously, cite the essential paragraphs verbatim,
and then refute them one by one.

After two introductory paragraphs, in which Basil unmasks the dishonest intentions of Eunomius, bk, 1 first dismisses the main thesis, that the Father’s attribute of being αϒεννητοϛ refers to his substance and that the Son’s substance as the
begotten one therefore has to be different from the Father’s. That the Father and
the Son, rather, have to be equally eternal can be seen from the contradictions in
Eunomius’s doctrine of time itself, when he asserts that the Son is creature but begotten “before all time.” Book 2 continues this argument by taking the Son's
creatureliness and the arguments asserted for it by Eunomius ad absurdum. “Begotten” does not mean that the Son once did not exist, nor does it have anything to
do with passions (παθη), since the latter would imply that God is mutable. Consequently, the Holy Spirit should not be viewed as a creation of the Son. Book 3
therefore distinguishes the differences between the three divine persons on the level
of sequence and honor but not of substance. As for the Holy Spirit, it is precisely
the names “Holy Spirit” and “Paraclete” that demonstrate the Spirit’s divine nature.

### 2. De Spiritu Sancto

Ten years later, from late 374 to late 375, Basil wrote a treatise specifically on
the Holy Spirit, addressed to Amphilochius of Iconium, who apparently had
made such a request. The thirty chapters together do not show any systematic
structure but rather revolve around the main theme, namely, that the Holy Spirit
is worthy of the same honor as the Father and the Son, which points to his
consubstantiality with them. The first and last chapters frame the tractate in the
form of a letter. The treatise is structured in three parts, each building upon the
other. Chapters 2-5 begin with the theological issue; Basil had been criticized by
the Pneumatomachians (a term he himself uses to designate them, although it is
not possible to determine with certainty whether he already has a specific party in
mind) that the doxology he used in the liturgy, “with the Holy Spirit” (συν τώ πνευματι τώ αϒιω), instead of the traditional formulation “in the Holy Spirit” (συν τώ πνευματι τώ αϒιω), inappropriately accords the Holy Spirit the same honor as the
Father and the Son. As a first step in response, chs. 6-8 explain the όμοτιμια of the

[#page-273]

Father and the Son, which among orthodox Christians is uncontested and consistent with their όμουσια. Finally, chs. 9-30, whose structure is subject to a variety
of interpretations in its details, substantiate the doctrine of the three hypostases
on the same level by safeguarding the μουαρχια of the one God. The evidence provided appeals to the witness of Scripture, the baptismal formula, and the Holy
Spirit’s part in the creation and in the plan of redemption. The oneness of nature
with the Father and the Son therefore entitles the Holy Spirit to the same titles
and honors as are accorded them.

In the history of theology, ch. 29 has gained particular importance because
here Basil for the first time specifically applies the method of “the evidence of the
Fathers” (__argumentum patristicum__). Although the church from the beginning,
and increasingly so during the dogmatic disputes of the fourth century, appealed
to the well-established witness of tradition, Basil here adduces for the first time
the opinions of a whole range of church fathers in support of his argumentation
or, more specifically, of the use of συν in the doxology. Augustine and Cyril of Alexandria (at the Council of Ephesus in 431) continued this method; it has been
perpetuated since then until the present and continues to have validity by safeguarding a historically and dogmatically critical appreciation of the material.
This method is not a mere stringing together of arbitrarily selected patristic citations without evidential value.

### 3. Letters

The corpus of letters by Basil numbers 368; thirty-six or thirty-eight of
them were not written by him, however. In keeping with general ancient practice,
Basil’s collection of letters also contains fifteen or seventeen letters addressed to

[#page-274]

him, namely, by Libanius (336, 338, 340, 341, 345, 346, 349, 352, 354, 355, 357, 358), Apollinaris of Laodicea (362 and 364), Gregory of Nazianzus (367), and
Emperor Julian (39 and 40). The authenticity of the latter two is under discussion, however; in the case of __Ep__. 39, the question is whether it is addressed to
Basil, and in the case of __Ep__. 40, whether Julian can be its author.

Inauthentic letters that are part of his correspondence, that is, those not
written by Basil and also not addressed to him, include the following: 8, 16, 38(?), 41-45, 47, 166, 167, 169-171, 189, 331, 342, 343, 347, 348, 360, 365, and 366.

_Epistulae_ 10, 342, 347, and 348 are also found in the corpus of letters of his youngest brother, Gregory of Nyssa, numbered 21, 28, 26, and 27, but they do belong to Basil (cf. II.B.1).

The Maurists (Benedictines of St. Maur) divided the corpus into three
major chronological parts: __Ep__. 1-46, before Basil’s consecration as bishop (357-370); 47-291, during his episcopacy (370-379); and 292-365, representing letters
that cannot be dated with precision. Johannes Quasten (__Patrology__ 3:220-26) organizes the letters into eight groups:

a. Letters of friendship: 1, 3, 4, 7, 12-14, 17, 19-21, 27, 56-58, 63, 64, 95, 118, 123, 124, 132-135, 145-149, 152-158, 162-165, 168, 172-176, 181, 184-186, 192-196, 198, 200, 201, 208-210, 232, 241, 252, 254, 255, 259, 267, 268, 271, 278, 282, 285, 320, 332-334.

b. Letters of recommendation: 3, 15, 31-37, 72-78, 83-88, 96, 104, 108-112, 137, 142-144, 177-180, 271, 273-276, 279-281, 303-319.

c. Letters of consolation: 5, 6, 28, 29, 101, 107, 139, 140, 206, 227, 238, 247, 256, 257, 269, 300-302.

d. Canonical letters: 53, 54, 188, 199, 217. The last three, addressed to Amphilochius of Iconium, offer meticulous instructions for the discipline of repentance and were adopted into the universal legislation of the Eastern church.

e. Moral and ascetical letters: 2, 10-11, 14, 18, 22-26, 49, 65, 83, 85, 97, 106, 112, 115, 116, 161, 173, 174, 182, 183, 197, 219-222, 240, 246, 249, 251, 259, 277, 283, 291-299, 366.

f. Dogmatic letters: 9, 38(?), 52, 105, 113, 114, 125, 129, 131, 159, 175, 210, 214, 226, 233-236, 251, 258, 261, 262. The lengthy __Ep__. 38 is also handed down as a tractate among the works of Gregory of Nyssa, titled __Ad Petrum fratrem de differentia essentiae et hypostaseos__. The question of ownership is still a matter of controversy today.

g. Liturgical letters: 93, 207.

[#page-275]

A list of Basil’s most important partners in correspondence, encompassing the entire Roman Empire, illustrate most impressively the scope and extent of his letter writing:

- Bishop Ambrose of Milan (cf. ch. 7.III): 197;

- Bishop Amphilochius of Iconium, Basil’s friend and cousin of Gregory of Nazianzus: 150, 161, 176, 188, 190, 199-202, 217, 218, 231-236, 248;

- Bishop Apollinaris of Laodicea (cf. 6.1): 361, 363; Patriarch Athanasius of Alexandria (cf. ch. 5.IV): 61, 66, 67, 69, 80, 82;

- Bishop Barses of Edessa: 264, 267;

- Pope Damasus: 371;
- Bishop Diodore of Tarsus (cf. ch. 7.IV): 135, 1605

- Bishop Epiphanius of Constantia (Salamis) (cf. ch. 7.11): 258;

- Bishop Eusebius of Samosata: 30, 34, 48, 95, 98, 100, 127, 128, 136, 138,
141, 145, 162, 198, 209(?), 213(2), 237, 239, 241, 268;

- Bishop Eustathius of Sebaste: 79, 119, 223;

- Bishop Gregory of Nazianzus, Basil’s university friend (cf. II.C): 2, 7, 14,19,71, 3685

- Bishop Gregory of Nyssa, Basil’s younger brother (cf. II.B): 38, 58;

- Himerius, the famous rhetor under whom Basil studied in Athens: 274, 275(2);

- Patriarch Meletius of Antioch (cf. part 3.II.A.2.b): 57, 68, 89, 120, 129, 216;

- Libanius, the famous rhetor under whom Basil studied in Constantinople: 335, 337, 339, 344, 350, 351, 353, 356, 359 (their correspondence involved a total of twenty-five letters [335-359], of which 342, 343, 347, and 348 are not authentic and 336, 338, 340, 341, 345, 346, 349, 352, 354, 355, 357, and 358 represent letters of Libanius addressed to Basil);

- Patriarch Peter of Alexandria: 133, 266.

In addition, there are a number of letters addressed to unnamed bishops,
priests, monks, magistrates, groups of them, and entire congregations; they demonstrate the extent to which Basil brought influence to bear not only upon particular situations but also structurally upon public life, ecclesiastical policy, and
teligious life:

- rural bishops (54), bishops in the West (90), bishops in Italy (92), bishops in coastal areas (203), Italic and Gallic bishons (243). hishons in

 
[#page-276]

- presbyters of Tarsus (113), clerics in Neocaesarea (207), cleric of Samosata (219), cleric of Colonia (227), cleric of Nicopolis (229), presbyter of Nicopolis (238), presbyter of Antioch (253), cleric of Sozopolis (261);

- community of Tarsus (114), Neocaesareans (204), men of Neocaesarea (210), Chalcidians (222), Occidentals (242, 263), Nicopolitans (246, 247), people of Evaesae (251);

- concerning monastic life (22), a female ascetic (46), female ascetics (52), monks (257, 295);

- governor of Neocaesarea (63), a governor (84, 86), governor of Sebaste (306); a _censitor_ (83, 284, 299, 312, 313), an officer (106), a _numerarius_ (142, 143), a _tractator_ (144), councilors of Samosata (183), decurions of Colonia (228), decurions of Nicopolis (230), a _commentariensis_ (286), a _comes privatarum_ (303), a principalis (311), a _notarius_ (333).

There is no addressee for the following letters: 35-37, 77, 78, 85, 87, 88, 101, 117, 165, 191, 209, 213, 249, 270, 273, 275, 285, 287-289, 298, 301, 305, 307-310, 314-320, 322, 326, 327, 330-332.

This overview alone shows clearly what a treasure trove Basil’s letters offer regarding his person and personal relationships, his politics and ecclesiastical policies, his pastoral and social activities, and his theology and spirituality. Furthermore they also present excellent examples of fine epistolary form and exemplary
style. His friend Gregory of Nazianzus praises him in __Ep__. 51 as an expert in the field,
and his teacher Libanius considered him to be of even greater quality in epistolary
skills than himself and wrote to him so (__Ep__. 338):

> ‘When the carriers handed me your letter and I silently scanned it in its entirety, !
smiled and said joyfully, “We are vanquished.” “What victory did they win over
you,” they asked, “and why, being overcome, are you not sad?” “In the beauty of the
letters,” I responded, “I have been conquered, and Basil has won. But the man is my
friend and for this reason I rejoice.” When I had said this, they wanted to understand the victory by means of the letter themselves. Alypius read it aloud and those
present listened; they concluded that I had not told them a lie. The reader, however,
kept the letter and went away in order to show it to others as well, I believe, and
scarcely returned it to me again. Therefore write similar letters and be victorious,
for that means victory for me!

### B. Gregory of Nyssa

Two individuals had a decisive impact on the life of Gregory of Nyssa:
Macrina, his eldest sister, who inspired him and his brothers concerning the ascetic life, and Basil, his older brother, whom he calls his “father and teacher” several times in his works. The extent to which these honorary titles can be adduced
to determine the concrete data of Gregory’s life remains uncertain, it is true, for
his writings contain very few datable references; external attestations are scarce,
and to date there is no in-depth modern, scholarly biography of Gregory. What
may be considered as certain is that his father died in Gregory's childhood and
Basil, his older brother, assumed a certain leadership role. How much younger
Gregory was and whether he had been his student in the technical sense when
Basil was teaching in Caesarea ca. 356 have to remain open issues.

It is generally assumed that Gregory was born between 335 and 340. Although he did not attend any of the famous schools in Caesarea, Constantinople,
or Athens, as did his brother Basil and their friend Gregory of Nazianzus, he acquired a thorough familiarity with rhetoric, philosophy, and the general knowledge of his time, as his works indicate, to the extent that, after he had first become
a lector, he preferred to work as a public rhetor. Many passages in his writings give
evidence of meticulous observation of his environment and human behavior patterns, as well as in-depth scientific, especially medical, knowledge. On the basis of

 
[#page-278]

a remark in _De virginitate_ 3 stating that he could no longer be blessed with the
fruits of virginity, it is generally assumed that Gregory was married (to Theosebeia?), although there is no further information to corroborate this.

When the province of Cappadocia was divided in 372 and the ecclesiastical
province over which Basil presided as metropolitan in Caesarea was thereby severely weakened, Basil, in order to strengthen the Nicene party, responded by
increasing the number of bishoprics and appointing brothers and friends as bishops in the remaining province, Cappadocia Prima. Among these was Gregory,
whom he appointed to Nyssa, an insignificant little place between Caesarea and
Ancyra. The period of his episcopate divides conspicuously into two very different segments. The break came in 379, that is, the year in which Basil, his brother,
and Macrina, his sister, died and in which the ecclesiastical-political situation
radically changed in favor of the Nicenes when Emperor Theodosius took office.
It remains unclear, however, what specific reasons account for the reversal. In any
case, Gregory’s initial seven years as bishop were marked by many difficulties.
Basil complained about Gregory’s naivete in ecclesiastical-political and interpersonal matters (__Ep__. 58 and 100) and in 375 refused to send him to Rome with a
delegation to negotiate, because he was “completely inexperienced in ecclesiastical matters” (__Ep__. 215). Indeed, in these years Gregory appears to have been so
inept that the Homoean opposition in Nyssa succeeded in deposing and exiling
him in 376 under the pretence of misappropriation of church property and irregularities associated with his appointment as bishop. He was able to return only on
August 9, 378, after the death of Emperor Valens.

In 379, however, the scene changed radically, Gregory suddenly emerged as
a sought-after and influential ecclesiastical politician, as a significant theologian
‘on the current dogmatic issues, as a respected speaker, preacher, and exegete;
until his life’s end, he maintained close relations with Constantinople, the capital,
and with the imperial household. At synods in Antioch (379) and Constantinople
(381, 382, 383, and 394), he was among the most prominent participants. The
synod of Antioch (379) appointed him to make a visitation to the diocese of
Pontus; in Ibora and Sebaste he guided the selection of new bishops and, to his
surprise, was himself elected as the metropolitan in Sebaste. He succeeded in regaining his mobility, however, by appointing Peter, his younger brother, as bishop.
At the second (a later enumeration) ecumenical Council of Constantinople in
381, he delivered an address entitled __De deitate adversus Evagrium__, important for
dogmatics. After the death of Meletius, the chairman of the council, he was given
the honorable task of delivering the funeral oration. After the council, according
to the imperial law confirming the resolutions of the councils (__Codex theodosianus__ 16.1, 3), he was reckoned among the “regular bishops,” that is, among
those who represented the standard of orthodoxy. In 381 he traveled to the
Roman province of Arabia and to Jerusalem on behalf of the council in order to
settle disputes there. To the synod in Constantinople of 383 he delivered the address __De deitate Filii et Spiritus Sancti__. The imperial court’s special appreciation of him can be seen in the invitation he received to deliver the funeral oration for
Princess Pulcheria who died in 385 and for Empress Flacilla. The information

[#page-279]

about Gregory's life ends with his entry in the list of the participants at the synod
in Constantinople in 394; from this it may well be assumed that he died shortly
thereafter.

#### 1. Works, Philosophy, and Theology

Gregory’s numerous and diverse works, only the most important of which
are mentioned here, divide into the following seven categories:

a. treatises on the current christological and Trinitarian issues of his time,
against the neo-Arians, Apollinarians, and Macedonians: __Contra Eunomium, Adversus Apollinarium__;

b. exegetical tractates and homilies: __In Hexaemeron__, __De hominis opificio__, __In
Ecclesiasten__, __In Canticum Canticorum__, __De vita Moysis__, __De oratione dominica__,
__De beatitudinibus__;

c. ascetical and spiritual writings: __De virginitate__;

d. hagiographic works: __Vita Macrinae__, __Vita Gregorii Thaumaturgi__, __In Basilium fratrem__, __In sanctum Ephraim__;

e. sermons and orations delivered at the church’s festivals celebrating the
Lord and its saints, at funerals, on topics dealing with morality and practical life and on dogmatic questions;

f. the _Oratio catechetica_, a summation of the essential teachings of the Christian faith;

g. thirty letters, of which __Ep__. 21 and 26-28 do not belong to Gregory but to
Basil and __Ep__. 30 is addressed to Gregory by his brother Peter; together with
the letter corpora of Basil and Gregory of Nazianzus, they contain most of
what, on the whole, is the scarce biographical information on Gregory.

With a few exceptions, the chronology of his works cannot be determined
with certainty. _De virginitate_ can definitely be attributed to the initial segment of
the period of his episcopate, up to 379; only after Basil’s death did Gregory seem
to have developed into a prolific writer, and in many instances he continued his
brother’s work (__Contra Eunomium__, __In Hexaemeron__, __De hominis opificio__). To Basil’s _Contra Eunomium_ Eunomius had responded with an __Apologia apologiae__, to
which Gregory now replied in lieu of his deceased brother. Since he also follows
Basil’s methodology and each time cites the passages of the writing he is combating, he preserves a good part of the otherwise lost work of Eunomius. A further

[#page-280]

work was his own _refutatio_ of the creed Eunomius had presented at the Council
of Constantinople in 381.

Gregory’s philosophy was shaped by middle Platonism and early Neoplatonism, which becomes most prominent in the form and content of the dialogue __De
anima et resurrectione__, which he fashioned after Plato’s _Phaidon_ as a dialogue with
Macrina, his dying sister. The particularity of Gregory’s Platonism consists in
using it for the purpose of effectively recasting the Christian body of thought—a
characteristic that fundamentally distinguishes him from the other two Cappadocians and, over against them, has rightly earned him the reputation of a profound philosophical thinker.

As in the case of the other two Cappadocians, his theology is based on the
Alexandrian tradition of Philo and Origen. From Origen, whom he mentions by
name several times in his writings, he borrowed, for instance, the doctrine of the
αποκαταστασις, the restoration of all things at the end of time into the blissful primordial state, including Satan and the demons (following 1 Cor 15:25, on which
he wrote the tractate _Tunc et ipse filius_). The Second Council of Constantinople
(553) later condemned this teaching in its anathemas against Origen, though not
Gregory of Nyssa. Rather, the Second Council of Nicea (787) still honored him
with the honorary title “Father of Fathers.” In his ascetical and mystical theology,
the `επεκτασις` (following Phil 3:13) played a significant part, as he explains in exemplary fashion in the _Vita Moysis_: after one puts off earthly passions, salvation
consists in ascending to God and in the subsequent infinite progression in knowing the infinite God.

In the modern era, Gregory’s sermons have frequently been dismissed
with the summary judgment that they “show the pompous pathos of contemporary rhetoric and are not as powerful and vivid as those of the two other
Cappadocians”footnote:[B. Altaner and A. Stuiber, Patrologie: Leben, Schriften, und Lehre der Kirchenvater]—unfairly so, as more recent investigations demonstrate.

### 2. Continuing Influence and History of Research

For reasons still to be examined more closely, Gregory, especially in the
Western church, has not attained the same importance as the two other “great Cappadocians.” Yet the large number of extant manuscripts of his works, as well as
translations into Latin and especially Syriac, help us to recognize the admiration
and dissemination of his body of thought. In the twentieth century, Gregory became one of the best-researched church fathers because Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, the famous classical philologist, entrusted the critical edition of his
works to Werner Jaeger, his student, precisely because of Gregory’s remarkable
style. He began in Berlin together with Giorgio Pasquali and, after his work at
Harvard University (1939), consulted a multitude of international fellow experts.
since his death in 1961, the task is continued partly in Frankfurt (Hermann
Langerbeck, Hadwig Horner) and partly by the Gregor-von-Nyssa Institut in
Münster; since 1969 some international colloquia have met at three- or four-year
intervals.

## C. Gregory of Nazianzus

We are quite well informed about the chronology of his life and works because Gregory of Nazianzus wrote an extensive Carmen de vita sua, and his writings contain numerous references to his biography. He was born either in the
small town of Nazianzus, where his father, Gregory the elder (d. 374 as a centenarian), was the bishop for forty-five years, or at the nearby family estate at
Arianzus. Beyond this, however, Gregory remains deliberately silent about his
childhood, so his date of birth has to be inferred. Traditionally he was thought to
 
[#page-284]

have been about the same age as Basil (b. 329/330). Christoph Jungckfootnote:[C, Jungck, 1974, 231-33.], along with Bernhard Wyssfootnote:[B. Wyss, RAC 12:794.] and Christoph Klockfootnote:[C. Klock, 1987, 84. Bibliographic information is given under Gregory of Nyssa.], however, argued for 326, following
Clémencet and Sinko, which fits quite well with some of Gregory's remarks in
which he appears to be older than Basil. Justin Mossayfootnote:[J. Mossay, TRE 14:164f.], on the other hand, is of
the opinion that Gregory had already been born ca. 300. But although this early
date makes it very difficult to conceive that Gregory and Basil, despite the age difference of thirty years, jointly studied in Caesarea and Athens, Mossay’s arguments seem to me entirely compatible with a date of birth in 326: Gregory’s claim
to be older; that in Constantinople (381) he was considered an “old man’; and
that his mother, Nonna, who was of the same age as her husband according to _Or. Bas._ 18.41, must have been fifty years old when Gregory was bornfootnote:[Could it be that Gregory’s description of his mother as a “spiritual Sarah” points in the same direction?]. More likely
the information of Suda (ca. 1000), that Gregory was ninety years old when he
died in 390 ought to be viewed with suspicion.

Gregory enjoyed an outstanding education equal to that of Basil the Great,
first in Cappadocian Caesarea, where he probably met the latter for the first
timefootnote:[The statement of earlier patrologists that Gregory had met Basil first in Athens needs to be corrected accordingly, especially by J. Mossay (TRE 14:165), who erroneously appeals to Or. Bas. 43.13.], then in Caesarea in Palestine, in Alexandria, and at the academy in Athens, where he became acquainted with Julian, the later emperor, and again saw
Basil, with whom he maintained a lifelong friendship from then on. According to
Basil, Gregory returned to his home ca. 356 to teach rhetoric, as did Basil, but
under the influence of his friend, he soon turned to the ascetic life and spent
some time with him in his monastic community in Annesi on the river Iris (in the
province of Pontus), where they jointly compiled the _Philocalia_, a collection of
texts from the writings of Origen. He was baptized, and in 361 his father ordained
him to the priesthood in order to assist him in the ministry in the diocese of
Nazianzusfootnote:[Only Justin Mossay (“‘La date de loratio II de Grégoire de Nazianze et celle de son ordination,” Mus 77 1964: 175-86, and again in TRE 14:166) moves it to 365 or into the reign af Emporer Julian (361-363) or Valens (364-378).] Because he viewed the ordination as “forced,” however, he refused to
assume his office and did not return until Easter 362, when, while preaching, he
apologized for his hesitation (__Or. Bas.__ 1). This was followed by a second apology
in the form of an address with a lengthy treatise on the priesthood (__Or. Bas.__ 2),
which subsequently inspired John Chrysostom to write his famous __De sacerdotio__.
At this point, there comes to the fore for the first time one of Gregory’s character
traits, which was to be part of his whole life and would guide it decisively several
times: his love was aimed at erudition and rhetoric, in which he had no equal
among the Greek fathers of the fourth century. Because of requests and out of

[#page-285]

practical necessity, he neglected these at times. If he was able to withdraw to
scholarly leisure, however, he was glad, especially since, given his sensitive character, he was not able to cope with the difficulties of ecclesiastical politics as effectively as Basil.

In the context of increasing the bishoprics and of strengthening the Nicene
party in his diocese after the division of the province of Cappadocia, Basil appointed him in 372 as bishop of Sasima, a small but not unimportant town because it was situated at a crossroads. Gregory declined to assume the diocese,
however, and instead continued to assist his father in his hometown, Nazianzus,
until his death (374). After this he withdrew to Seleucia in Isauria, where he received a call after the death of Emperor Valens (August 9, 378) to lead the small
Nicene community in the capital. Since the great majority of Christians in the
capital belonged to the Arian confession under Bishop Demophilus, Gregory resided in a private residence (the later Anastasia Church), where he held the famous “five theological orations,” in which he explained the Nicene doctrine of
the Trinity and which earned him the honorary title “the theologian” (attested for
the first time in the council documents of Chalcedon in 451); Jerome was also
among his audience. Immediately after his move to Constantinople on November
24, 380, Theodosius forced Bishop Demophilus to leave the city and introduced
Gregory as bishop of the capital. The Council of Constantinople (381) acknowledged him as such and, after the death of Meletius of Antioch, elected him as chairman of the council. He was not, however, successful in mediating an acceptable
agreement between the various parties of the council regarding both the Meletian
schism in Antioch and the symbolum. Instead he came under fire to the extent
that he was even accused of having been transferred illegitimately to the episcopal
see of Constantinople because he already was bishop of Sasima. As a result,
Gregory submitted his resignation, which was accepted with approval. He took
leave in his famous farewell address (__Or. Bas.__ 42) and returned to Nazianzus even
before the council ended and there administered the bishopric until Eulalius, his
cousin, was installed as bishop in 383. Subsequently he retreated to the family estate near Arianzus, where he presumably died in 390.

The final part of his life, beginning with his call to Constantinople (379),
represents Gregory’s most prolific period of literary activity. During this time he
wrote half of the forty-four extant sermons, most of the 249 letters, and the bulk
of his poetry. His remains rested in the left front crossing pillar of St. Peter’s in
Rome from June 11, 1580, until Pope John Paul II returned them, along with the
remains of John Chrysostom, to Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople on
November 27, 2004.

### 1. Poetry

Although Gregory of Nazianzus was not the first to give poetic form to
theological material and Christian themes, he was the first to write a fully developed, extensive poetic oeuvre of 17,000 verses that is unmatched in Greek
patristics. His __Carmina__, most of which he wrote after his return from Constantinople, in the secluded leisure that he enjoyed at Arianzus until his death, are composed of didactic poems, hymns, elegies, and epigrams in their traditional meters,
from which Gregory does not deviate on the whole, namely, the hexameter,
distich, and iambic. He deals with dogmatic, moral, autobiographical, and lyrical
themes, with the explicit intent (__Carmina__ 2.1.39) of using the poetic form to proclaim the Christian message more pleasantly and more attractively and to provide a
comparable Christian expression alongside Hellenistic poetry. With the quality
of his poems, Gregory decisively refutes the former polemic charge that Christians lacked education and comparable literature.

Recently _Christus patiens_, the drama handed down under Gregory’s name,
has again been defended as authentic by André Tuilier and Francesco Trisogliofootnote:[Tuilier, ed. and trans., La passion du Christ (SC 149; Paris: Cerf, 1969), 11-18. F, Trisoglio, La passione di Cristo (CTePa 16; Rome: Citta Nuova, 1979), 13-16; the 1990 second edition did not take into account the critique by Wyss.],
without sufficient reasons, to be sure, as Bernhard Wyssfootnote:[B, Wyss, RAC 12:812.] counters so aptly. It may be dated to the twelfth century.

#### 2. Orations

The Maurist edition encompasses forty-five orations and sermons of Gregory; the thirty-fifth is not attributed to him, however. The time frame for
their composition ranges from his consecration as bishop in 362 to his retirement in Arianzus in 383. Half of them are concentrated in the period beginning with his call to Constantinople in 379. Some are orally presented speeches that he himself prepared for publication, and some are literary works in oral form. The latter certainly applies to _Or. Bas._ 4 and 5, representing invectives against Julian the Apostate, the deceased emperor. All of Gregory’s orations stand out not only because of their masterly rhetoric but also, at the same time, because of their skill in presenting solutions to the difficult theological issues of his time clearly and persuasively. This is the case particularly in the five “theological orations” (27-31), which he himself identified as such (28.1) and which, in the main, brought him his honorary title of “theologian.” He delivered them during his time in Constantinople (379-381), probably in 380 in the private residence that later became the Anastasia Church, for the cathedral, the Church of the Apostles, still belonged to the Arian bishop. The terms “theological” and “theology” are to be construed in the strictly early-Christian sense of the “doctrine of God”; at issue is the presentation of the orthodox doctrine of the ‘Trinity in dispute with the Young Arians (Eunomians) and Macedonians (Pneumatomachians). Alongside the brilliant

[#page-290]
defense of the traditional Nicene doctrine of God, he finds the forward-looking formulation of the “procession” (`έκπορενσις`) of the Spirit from the Father, in distinction to the “generation” (`ϒεννησις`) of the Son, and for the first time insists on transferring consubstantility (`όμοουσιος`) to the Holy Spirit. Thus he goes beyond Basil and, by means of a more precise terminology, not only sharpens the understanding of the Holy Spirit within the Trinity but also prepares for the pneumatological amendments to the Nicene creed at the Council of Constantinople (381), which followed shortly.

NOTE: See original for references

#### 3. Letters

Following the classical example, Gregory himself published an initial collection of his letters, and he was the only Christian author to bequeath a brief outline of the theory of epistelography, in __Ep__. 51 (cf. ch. 4.IV.excursus). Of the  249 extant letters, __Ep__. 246~248 are also handed down as __Ep__. 169-171 in the corpus
of Basil the Great, __Ep__. 243 is inauthentic, and __Ep__. 241 is suspect. In form, all of
them are literary letters, but in content, they are largely the day-to-day correspondence of an educated man and bishop. Three of them have gained great theological importance as the “three theological letters” supporting the “five theological
orations,” namely __Ep__. 101 and 102, dated summer 382 and addressed to the presbyter Cledonius, who led the diocese during the vacancy in the see of Nazianzus
following the death of Gregory the elder (374), and __Ep__. 202, addressed to
Nectarius (ca. 387), the successor of Gregory and the predecessor of John
Chrysostom as patriarch of Constantinople (381-397). Nectarius was not a theologian but at his consecration had been a senator and a catechumen. He accordingly dealt little with the urgent theological questions of his time, although, in
contrast to his predecessor and his successor, he successfully avoided disputes
with the people of the church and with the imperial household. Gregory sent __Ep__. 202 to him as an admonition to be cautious with the ongoing machinations of the Arians, Macedonians, and Apollinarians, but also as a bit of theological assistance.

If the five theological orations had clarified the one major theological issue
of the time of Gregory, namely, the doctrine of the Trinity in dispute with the Arians and Pneumatomachians, the three theological letters address mainly the
other issue, namely, Christology in the discussion against Apollinaris. In a decisive and forward-looking way, __Ep__. 101.32 defines the completeness of the two natures in Christ: “For that which he has not assumed he has not healed, but that which is united to his Godhead is also saved” (`Greek`). The differentiation of the natures as `greek` in distinction to the three persons in the Trinity as `greek` (101.20-21) supplements the formula. Subsequently the Council of Ephesus (431) appealed to a lengthy paragraph from __Ep__. 101, and in its documents the Council of Chalcedon (451) appropriated it in its entirety.

Generally, Gregory’s works and theology have been very widely disseminated and have exerted great influence, as shown by the more than twelve hundred extant Greek manuscripts of his orations, the translations into Latin and some Eastern languages, and the numerous scholia. Alongside individual editions and _editiones minores_ of Gregory’s writings, the poems and orations have been emerging since 1977 as _editiones maiores_ under the patronage of the Gérres-Gesellschaft, led by Justin Mossay (Louvain) and Martin Sicherl (Münster) and
including numerous international collaborators.

## II. COUNCIL OF CONSTANTINOPLE (381)

On January 19,379, Emperor Theodosius assumed power, and on August 3
of the same year, he issued the order that only the Nicene creed was accepted
empire-wide. When he further called on the entire empire on February 27,380, to adhere to the Nicene expression of Christianity and replaced Demophilus, the Arian patriarch of Constantinople, with Gregory of Nazianzus immediately after his move to the capital. On November 24,380, the victory of the faith of Nicea, after more than fifty years of battle for its reception, was sealed. Granted, what was still lacking was its ecclesiastical sanctioning, for according to early Christian opinion, neither an emperor nor a bishop nor even a patriarch was able to lay down valid norms of faith for the entire church by his own absolute power; only a council that is as inclusive as possible-in other words, "ecumenical"-could do this. (This principle also applies to the Council of Constantinople [381]. It did not describe itself as ecumenical, and it was composed exclusively of bishops from the Eastern church. Only the Council of Chalcedon [451] ushered in its recognition as ecumenical.) This was also the reason that after the Council of Nicea (325), confusingly many synods were held on all sides.

Now, fifty-five years after the Council of Nicea, a simple confirmation of the Nicene creed was no longer sufficient; there had been too much development, both ecclesiastically-politically and theologically. Now Arianism had to be opposed in the form of Eunomianism, and the Meletian schism of Antioch had to be resolved. The resultant theological problems with the doctrine of the Trinity and, for the first time, with Christolog¡ called for a binding clarification: the question of the divinity of the Spirit (Macedonians/Pneumatomachians) and of the kind of unity between the two natures in Christ (Apollinaris). For this reason, Theodosius summoned a synod soon after he moved to Constantinople at the end of 380 or early 381, which met in Constantinople from May to July. One hundred fifty bishops participated, among them Meletius of Antioch as presiding officer; Gregory of Nazianzus; Gregory of Nyssa and Peter, his brother, of Sebaste; Cyril of Jerusalem; and Diodore of Tarsus.
