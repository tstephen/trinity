## Zwingli (1484-1531)

In Zurich the Reformation came in the way normal among
the free cities of the Holy Roman Empire. The leading
citizens were influenced by the reforming doctrines; they
resisted and repudiated the authority of the Bishop of
Constance when he tried to interfere; the city council
legislated to reform the churches and parishes, with the
advice of its chief pastors, to allow clerical marriage, to
remove superstitious images and relics, to suppress. the
monasteries and use their endowments for education, and
to order a vernacular and simplified liturgy instead of the
mass, The process began in 1522 and was complete by
1525, As in other cities, the council followed with reforming
regulations to control public morals,

Zwingli claimed that his reform was: independent of
Luther’s, that he had been teaching reforming doctrines
before he had heard of Luther. An examination of the
evidence does not wholly support his claim. Zurich received
an impetus from the Lutheran revolt like every other free
city in the Empire, and at the time Zwingli was eagerly
interested in Luther’s teaching and Luther’s methods. But
the same fuel was everywhere present; so was the same
appeal from the Church authorities to the Scripture. The
Reformation did not all spring from Luther, it sprang from
‘those conditions of the Church and those states of mind
which made Luther possible. Zwingli was not deluding
himself in claiming that he held reforming ideas before he
heard of Luther. But the news from Wittenberg drastically
affected events in Zurich.

Like “Luther, ‘but “more. ‘sympatheti than Li
quest for reform by cool ridicule.He had more wit, more
philosophy, more learning, less profundity, ‘less religious
sense than Luther. His desire to reform the Church was.a
little more like the desire of the humanist who hated inefficiency and obscurantism than like the desire of the ex-friar who
had fought through a storm of temptation’ to defend the
souls of his people. He was less pessimistic about human
nature, more hopeful about the destiny of good heathen.
But he was not only a humanist. As he studied the Greek
fathers to whom Erasmus led him, and as he came under
the influence of St Augustine, he found the same religious
needs and insights that were central in Luther’s heart.
Neither Zwingli nor Calvin allowed friends, admiring their
intellects and following their reasoning like disciples, to see
their inwardness; they captured men’s allegiance by the
cool force of their minds. Luther always remained a man.of
the heart, he opened his inward thoughts and feelings to
thesight and affection; he captured allegiance more by moral
stature than by subtlety of mind. The contrastmust not beexted. The more we know of the two Swiss reformers,
the less possible we find it to treat them merely as intellectuals, But a measure of this strikes everyone who seeks to
penetrate the sources to the character and minds of the
three men, H
Zwingli felt less reverence for the past than Luther, le
respect for traditional ways of wechipl The pital!
Zurich were transformed in appearance. Relics and organs
were removed, pictures ‘and images were sold or smashed,
surviving altars were stripped bare of ornament, and the
new German order for the Lord’s Supper (1525) bore small
resemblance to the medieval liturgy. After a sermon and
prayers, unleavened bread and wine were placed not upon
an altar but upon a table in the middle of the nave, surrounded by the congregation. The ministers faced the
congregation, wore lay clothes, and carried the bread in
large wooden trenchers round to the ‘silent people sitting
ae seats. Zwingli instituted other services almost without
liturgical form and composed only of a sermon and prayers.
Luther believed that nothing in the service should be
contrary to the Word of God. But as his conservative temperament assumed to be permissible whatever Scripture did
not explicitly forbid, he had not sought to abolish the elevation of the Host or the eucharistic vestments. Zwingli,
likewise believing that nothing in the service should be
contrary to the Word of God, surrounded this belief with
a different atmosphere. To his mind the Scripture ought
explicitly to sanction what was done in the service; and
although he recognized an area of ‘things indifferent , such
as the wording of the prayers, where the minister or the
Church was free to make any edifying rule, he assumed that
simplicity ought everywhere to prevail. The change of
appearance and worship in the Swiss churches was therefore
more revolutionary than in the churches of northern Germany. In some of the Lutheran churches hymnody flowered
under Luther’s impetus. The Swiss churches thought hymns
unscriptural and provided metrical versions of the Psalms,
‘The Lutheran churches continued to use private confession as a sacrament; the Swiss churches did not prohibit
private penitence with a pastor but believed the sacrament
unwarranted by Scripture, a cause of priestly power, and
therefore a corruption.

## THE REAL PRESENCE

This difference, as much of attitude as of principle, began
to turn upon the doctrine of the eucharist.

It could not be denied that the mass had been the focus
of much popular superstition. Zwingli, like Luther, believed
that the mass was not a sacrifice, and wished to eliminate
the sacrificial language. Unlike Luther, he also believed
that the Christian doctrine of the eucharist had been
corrupted by the notion that Christ’s Body was ‘substanti~
ally’ or ‘corporeally’ present in or under the elements of
bread and wine. His mind: sharply’ distinguished. the
material from the spiritual, and shrank from the idea:that
physical objects might be vehicles of spiritual gifts. He
always preferred to treat the sacraments rather as symbols
and signs of a covenant between God and man’ than as
means of grace. The Lord’s Supper was a memorial of the
Lord’s death and a thanksgiving for it. In his early years
as a Reformer he and his friend Occolampadius of Basle
were so engaged upon saying what the Lord’s Supper was
not, that they rarely and reluctantly attempted to describe
what it was. His reading of the Bible suggested to him that
the doctrine of the Real Presence (in those days the word
real was used to mean substantial or corporeal) was a mis=
understanding. The gift is the spiritual gift of Christ’s
redemption, and a spiritual gift cannot be received physically but only by faith, And when it was put to him that in
the text of the Bible Jesus said ‘This is my Body’, he
and Oecolampadius replied that this was the normal mode
of metaphor used by Jesus. He said ‘I am the door’,
‘I am the vine’; but no one insisted that these statements
be understood literally. ‘This is my Body’ must be understood to mean ‘this is a sign of my Body’, The bread and
wine were not vehicles of a present Christ, but signs of a
Christ present by faith,

During the last four years of his life, under pressure from.
his enemies and perhaps some of his colleagues, he made
more positive assertions, These signs, though signs of the
absent, are efficacious or grace-bearing signs, they are
special modes of the universal presence of the divine Spirit,
they focus that gift which we also receive when we pray.
He never allowed the traditional doctrine that in the
Lord’s Supper there is a true communication of the Lord’s
humanity to the faithful soul.

## THE COLLOQUY OF MARBURG, 1529

Luther thought that Zwingli was depriving the faithful
Christian of that comfortable assurance promised in the
Gospel, and that he was applying rational ‘argument to.a
mystery beyond all argument. He could not regard the
Swiss as faithful men. The Landgrave Philip of Hesse,
painfully aware of a political: need for unity among the
Protestants, arranged in 1529 a conference at Marburg
where, he hoped, peaceable discussion would reunite. the
two sides, At Marburg he gathered Luther, Zwingli,
Melanchthon, Bucer;: Oecolampadius, and other leading
divines, They agreed upon much, but on the eucharist
they failed altogether. Luther began the discussion by
writing on the table the words ‘This is my Body’ and
announced that he would never depart from them..‘I am
not going to argue whether Js can mean is a sign of. I am
content with what Christ said. ... The devil cannot: get
out.of that.’ Thereafter he would never extend the hand. of
friendship to the disciples of Zwingli. Melanchthon suffered
qualms that the difference was not as simple as either side
supposed, and hankered after a reconciliation. Luther
moved not a step, and the cleavage among the Protestants
grew deeper. And as the divines of some Rhineland cities
andtheLow Countries followed Zwingli and Oecolampadius
rather than Luther, those churches began to look for
guidance and leadership rather to Zurich than to Witten
berg. .

Sword and battle-axe in hand, Zwingli was killed {n 1531
at the fight of Kappel between Zurich and the Catholic
cantons. He was succeeded as chief pastor by Henry
Bullinger (died 1575), of a wise and moderate temper, who
directed a European correspondence as Zurich became a
guide and a model for other Protestant cities.

## BUCER (1491-1551)

Martin Bucer, the reformer of Strasbourg, devoted a main
part of his career to reconciling the Zwinglians with the
Lutherans. Like other negotiators he sometimes supposed
that finding the right formula was the same as reconciling
the contending parties, and he never suffered from the fault
of being too laconic in his explanations, Luther once eer
him ‘that chatterbox’, But Bucer was more than-a mere
diplomat of negotiator;"he was'a man of principle ‘and
among the most learned and level-headed of the Protestants.
After being an adherent of Luther, he had been convinced
by Zwingli’s argument. that a physical reception: of a
spiritual gift was impossible and that the channel of
tion was faith. But hevalso perceived the force in the
Lutheran contention that the Scripture revealed a. true
communication of the Lord’s humanity in the sacrament;
He therefore proposed that the true statement of the matter
should use the preposition with, The divine gift was*not
given in or under the forms of bread and wine ~ thus far
Zwingli was right, But it was given in an indissoluble conjunction with them ~ as the bread is given to the body, so the
divine gift passes into the faithful soul. This divine gift was
the humanity of the Lord, as the Catholic Church believed
it to be. Therefore Luther was right in contending that an
shee gift was offered to the communicant, and Zwingli
was right in contending that the faithless. i
nothing but ee second
This is in outline the doctrine which came later to. be
known as ‘receptionism’, and was destined in time to become the classical doctrine of non-Lutheran Protestantism.
One of its forms is the Calvinist doctrine, For Bucer’s long
sentences were compressed into a clear and coherent
explanation, impossible to misunderstand, by one of his
lieutenants, From 1538 to 1541 John Calvin, banished from
Geneva, was working under Bucer at Strasbourg.

## FAREL AT GENEVA

The city of Geneva, like so many other cities of the Empit

had been growing towards independence, though cae
slowly than Nuremberg or Strasbourg or Zurich. The arms
of the city of Berne, since: 1528 the most powerful city of
Protestant Switzerland, supported the desire of the Gene
vans to be independent of their bishop. The Bernese used the

Frenchman William Farel to reform the French-speaking
areas of Switzerland under their control, and it was a
natural extension of Bernese influence when Farel helped

the people of Lausanne to drive out their prince-bishop and
become a free Protestant city. Farel tried to work in
Geneva but was expelled. In 1533 Berne sent him back into
Geneva under diplomatic protection. Sermons, disputations,
riots, a siege marked the divided state of the citizens. Before
the end of 1535 Geneva was Protestant. It was an independent city but its independence was under the protection of
Berne,

## CALVIN (1509-64)

In the summer of 1536 Calvin passed through Geneva on
his way from Paris to Strasbourg, the haven of Protestant
refugees fleeing from France. Born at Noyon in 1509, he
studied Latin and theology at the University of Paris and
law at Orleans. He published in 1532 a reputable edition of
Seneca’s De clementia. Unsafe in Paris, he retreated to Basle,
and in 1536 issued a lucid handbook of Protestant theology,
The Institutes of the Christian Religion, Passing by chance
through the city of Geneva, he was persuaded by Farel to
stay. The city council offered him employment as a teacher
of Scripture.

Farel was no organizer. The Reformation in Geneva
consisted of little but broken statues and more sermons.
Calvin, who was trained as a lawyer, had been employed
at Geneva for some four months when he confronted the city
council with a programme of desirable reforms. He had a
tidy mind in practical affairs as well as on paper, and one
of the consuming passions of his life was a hatred of public
mess. He began to seek an organization of the Church and
ministry which should ensure decency and order. Like all
other Reformers he assumed that this could be achieved by
a systematic reproduction of the practices of the primitive’
Church as history and the New’ Testament disclosed them.

His first efforts to organize’ the Church were’stopped by
exile, from 1538 to 1541, for Geneva never wished to be
organized altogether as Calvin preferred. But the moment
he was recalled, triumphantly, he persuaded the city council
to establish a series of regulations known as the Ecclesiastical
Ordinances. Even when these regulations were revised twenty
years later bya Calvin firmly in the saddle, they still failed
to represent his precise ideal of an ecclesiastical polity. But
from 1541 the outline of his programme was being put into
practice.

He was a generation later than Luther. Luther married
an ex-nun, Calvin the widow of an Anabaptist; and the
difference is symbolic. The problem now was not the overthrow of a papacy, but the construction of new modes of
power. Luther rested much upon the doctrine of the priesthood of the laity and derived part of his practical programme from the doctrine. Calvin recognized that the
doctrine was in Scripture and emphasized the theoretical
consequences. But what was needed was the authority ofa
rightly called and purified ministry, In breaking down papal
authority, the Reformation seemed to have left the authority
of the Christian ministry vague and uncertain, Where
authority existed among the Protestant Churches, apart
from the personal authority of individual men of stature,
it rested with the prince or the city magistrate. Calvin
believed that in organizing the Church af Geneva he must
organize it in imitation of the primitive Church, and thereby
reassert the independence of the Church and the divine
authority of its ministers,

There was little that was democratic in Calvin’s ideal
constitution. The pastors chose the pastors, though the city
council could reject the choice. They were to meet once'a
week for the common study of the Scriptures, and this meeting was not voluntary. They chose the teachers, who were
responsible for the teaching of Scripture and for education
generally, though again the council insisted that the choice
should be ratified by themselves. The elders ~ the most
characteristic of Calvin’s institutions — were disciplinary
officials. It was their duty to survey the morals of their
congregations, to ensure that notorious sinners were not
permitted to receive holy communion, and to make reports
to the ‘Venerable Company’ of the pastors. These elders
were appointed by the councils of the city government,
after consultation with the pastors. Every Thursday they
were to meet with the pastors in consistory and consider
whether there was any disorder in the church requiring a
remedy. They were to summon before themselves heretics,
parishioners who ‘failed to attend their churches or who
treated the ministers with contempt. They were to admonish;
and if the sinner was still impenitent they might excommunicate him and inform the magistrate.

This control over the morals of the population was not
new. For centuries bishops’ courts and city councils had
decreed rules which a later generation would think an
intolerable tyranny over the liberty of the citizen. Calvin
wanted to give this right and duty to the authorities of the
Church, not of the State; and where the Church authorities
delivered a sinner to the civil power, the civil power would
punish him.

Like the councils of Basle, Berne, Zurich, and other Swiss
cities, the council of Geneva had no desire to give the power
of excommunication to their clergy. At every turn they
sought to add provisos in the Ordinances ensuring that the
pastors might act only after reference to the council. They
added a note to the final text of the Ecclesiastical Ordinances
which stated: ‘These arrangements do not mean that the
pastors have any civil jurisdiction, nor that the authority of
the consistory interferes in any way with the authority of
the magistrates and the civil courts.”

The addition betrayed an uneasiness. In a measure the
magistrates had already been forced to allow the right to
excommunicate, as a condition of Calvin’s return from exile.
They sought to restrict it not only. by these
additions but by insisting that a civil cae
the consistory, baton in hand, asa sign that he was acting
as a civil magistrate and not simply as-a lay elder. Calvin
at last succeeded in removing the baton in.156r.

The council always retained more control of the elections
to the consistory than he wholly approved, and they often
interpreted the above clause on jurisdiction in a way which
he vehemently disapproved.

The minutes of the consistory after 16 February 1542 are
extant. The offences are manifold, and not all.are as interesting as the following. A woman knelt upon the grave of
her husband and cried Requiescat in pace; others saw her and
started to copy her. A goldsmith made a chalice. Someone
said that the arrival of the French refugees had put up the
cost of living. A woman tried to cure her husband by tying
round his neck a walnut containing a spider, Another
danced. Another possessed a copy of the lives of the saints,
the Golden Legend. A woman of sixty-two married aman of
twenty-five. A barber gave the tonsure to a priest. Another blamed
Geneva for executing people for their religious opinions
Calvin saw danger lurking behind the trivial in moral
behaviour. An ordinance of 1547 renewed an older decree
of 1535 against the wearing of slashed breeches. But ‘we see
that, by the loopholes of the breeches, they wish to bring in
all manner of disorders’, He was inclined to take a grim
view of offences. When several distinguished citizens were
imprisoned for holding a dance in a private house, he became (for him) emotional, and declared his intention of
uncovering the truth ‘even at the cost of my life’,

In 1550 the magistrates authorized the clergy to make an
annual visit to the home of each parishioner, with a view to
et ene the houschold was keeping the rules of

The Reformation had set out to remedy the corruption,
superstition, and immorality of the Church and of society.
The pendulum had swung. The remedy was beginning to
work- ith an effectiveness beyond expectation.

The consistory was indefatigable in its maintenance of the
moral order. Its members’ tried to suppress fortune-telling
and sorcery, were pitiless towards merchants who defrauded
‘their clients, denounced short measures, excessive rates of
interest, a doctor who exacted high fees, a tailor who over-charged a travelling Englishman. They once compared
themselves to dogs which bark when their master is attacked. They thought of themselves as charged with the
protection of old people, orphans, widows, children, the
sick. They attempted to educate the public conscience and
somewhat resembled Hebrew prophets, with their courage,
their power, and their unpopularity.

The boundaries between the jurisdiction of Church and
State had never been easy to define, and they were not easy
to define in Geneva. Calvin, the practised lawyer, drafted
a revision of the city code for the council, a plan for a watch,
a cleaner mode of dispersing refuse. It was not easy to distinguish whether he was offering these suggestions as an
interested layman or as the chief pastor of the city. There is
a story that when the first dentist arrived in Geneva, Calvin
personally satisfied himselfthat the man was reputable before
he was allowed to practise; and though the story is probably

apocryphal, it represents a truth about the entanglement of
Church and State. The consistory gave its opinions on the
bank rate, on the level of interest for war loan, on exports
and imports, on speeding the law courts, on the cost of living
and the shortage of candles. On the other hand the council,
even during Calvin’s last years, may be found supervising
the clergy and performing other functions which logic
would have allotted to the consistory. The council was not
backward in protesting against overlong sermons, or against
pastors who neglected to visit the homes of the people; they
examined the proclamations by the pastors even if the
proclamation called the city to a general fast, sanctioned the
dates for days of public penitence, agreed or refused to lend
pastors to other churches, provided for the housing.and
stipend of the pastors, licensed the. printing of theological
books.

It is correct to speak neither of magistrates dominated. by
pastors nor of pastors dominated by magistrates. Some
people served on both council and consistory, and were|perhaps not always clear in their own minds whether they were
acting as Church or as State. A pastor who dominated the
consistory could not help being one of the rulers of State.as
well as of Church. That was one reason why Calvin worked
successfully with a constitution which was not quite faithful _
to his own ideas,

For Calvin was not the absolute ruler of Geneva pictured
by legend and his enemies. There were many matters.on
which he could not achieve all that he wanted. He wanted
the pastors to take the first steps in choosing the pastors,
and the council insisted on being associated with the work
of selection from the beginning. He wanted the pastors to be
present when the council elected the elders, and succeeded
in achieving this during his last few years, though the old
practice was restored eight years after his death. He wanted
the punishment of harlots to be severe, and it was never so
severe as he thought proper. In October 1558 the council at
last decreed that anyone guilty of a second offence should
be marched through the city with a cap on her head,
heralded by a trumpeter; but even then the council refused
to apply the penalty with rigour. In 1546 Calvin persuaded
the council to abolish taverns and establish cafés instead.
Stringent regulations determined conduct in these cafés,
banning indecorous conversation or bawdy songs, decreeing
that no meals should be served unless grace were said before
and after the meal, and that a French Bible should be
available for consultation on the premises. The cafés proved
unsuccessful, for the people preferred taverns, and the
taverns perforce were reopened. In 1546 there was an act
against the use of non-Biblical Christian names, and again
the people were too strong. He wanted the pastors to be
ordained with the laying-on of hands, and the council would
permit only prayers anda sermon: Nor was he able'to persuade the council to return all the ecclesiastical revenues
which they had appropriated, like so many cities or princes,
at the first rush of reform. This was no matter of principle
for him, and he made no strenuous efforts. The question
thow often the Lord’s Supper should be celebrated was
nearer to his heart. He believed that frequent, weekly, com‘munion was practised’ by the primitive Church and ought
to be practised by the Church in Geneva. Laymen in the
Middle Ages had been accustomed to'such infrequent communion that all the Reformers found this change one of the
mMiost difficult for the laity to accept. In the Ordinances of
1541 he restrained his request to a monthly communion, and
‘was refused even that. It was to be administered ‘for the
present’ four times in the year. "
© He was not popular. He was the kind of man who has
only disciples or opponents; it was impossible to be neutral
about him. He was known and beloved by a few intimates.
Asa dying man he said of the citizens of Berne: “They have
‘always feared me more than they loved me.’ And the same
‘would be a true verdict upon many of the citizens of Geneva.
Some of them are said to have called him Cain, one to have
siamed his dog after him. We hear of rude papers left in the
pulpit, of ballads written against him, of men who abused
‘him’as a hypocrite and a tyrant, of thirty tennis players suspected of choosing for their game the square outside the
church where he was teaching, of a rumour that someone
had offered 500 crowns to anyone who would assassinate
him, He knew what he wanted and could be rutkiless in
getting it. Although he could often be gentle, he found it
more difficult than most men to be gentle with opponents.
Aware that he was faithful to the teaching of the Bible, he
identified opposition to himself with contempt for God’s
Word, and knew that it must be beaten down, He was
naturally austere, with no pleasure in food or drink; one
almost suspects him of marrying to set an example..He lived
quietly in his house on the Rue des Chanoines, witha modest little stipend and-simple household and short hours of
sleep; he was always grave, he had none of Luther’s exuber=
ance and joy in life. There was no abandon, he held himself
upon a rein. When he had decided, he was inflexible. ‘If he
once gets his knife into you,’ said a fellow pastor, ‘you'do
not stand a chance.’ A manufacturer of toys and playing
cards named Ameaux, whose business was affected by the
discipline which. prohibited card-playing, said at a dinner
party that Calvin was a bad man anda foreigner .who
taught untrue doctrine. The council decided that he should
kneel and apologize to Calvin in their presence. Calvin
insisted that such an apology was not public enough, and he
would not preach again till proper satisfaction was performed. The council condemned Ameaux to walk
the city in a shirt, carrying a taper and asking God’s mercy,
If Calvin was restrained where Luther overflowed, if he
eschewed the coarsenesses which sometimes defiled Luther’s
conversation, he lacked Luther’s warmth and generosity,
He had little room for expediency, but his mind. was
neither narrow nor blinkered, Whereas Zwingli could be
contemptuous of opponents and Luther could rarely see
that they were other than wicked, Calvin could see that
they had argument and yet that this argument must be
beaten down. The air of inflexibility which he succeeded in
imparting to much of his work is primarily the air of a man
who is convinced by his own logic and who will follow the
reasoning to the utmost consequences, whatsoever they may
be and whether they are theoretical or practical. The logic
may not always be convincing to the abstract logician. The
Institutes, even in their final form, had a less inevitable
coherence than their popular reputation supposed. The
sense of coherence is conveyed to the reader as much by the
tidiness of the arrangement and clarity of the style as by any
relentless development of the argument from its axioms.
_He was a man of the intellect, a man of doctrine. Not even
his intimates could penetrate to his soul, as any reader of the
_Table Talk_ can penetrate Luther, There was’ something
‘aloof, secret, reserved. He was a man of ‘books, texts,
authorities; he lacked a feeling for natural beauty. Ifhe had
other feelings they were usually concealed. Itis a surprise to
see his tenderness of spirit when his wife died.
“It is at first sight atonticary that he Les Ee
dominated a city of which he was not evenia cit
1559 and wien he made no effort to cultivate popular
favour. Until 1555 the opposition within the city was
powerful. In 1548 he was summoned before the magistrate
to explain an intercepted letter, and was so rebuked for his
failure in duty that he believed himself about to go again
into exile, His disciples tried to discredit the opposition with
the name of libertines, but they were libertines only in the
unusual sense of holding opinions upon Church and State
different from those of Calvin. In 1553 Geneva burnt ‘the
Spaniard Servetus for his Trinitarian heresies, and thereby
shocked the Protestant radicals, Calvin had wished the
death to be more merciful than burning, but he had worked
to secure the execution, and some good men believed that
the severity should be blamed upon him. In the same year a
citizen of the libertine group named Berthelier, who was
excommunicate, asked the council and not the consistory,
the State authorities and not the Church authorities, for
ission to receive the sacrament two days later. The
council consented. Under the appendage to the Ordinances,
it was probably within its nen Calvin cus = =
that he would refuse the sacrament to any
akissse person. He expected to fall and be banished, he
even preached a farewell sermon. The council said that he
must obey their order, but, discretion being the better part
‘of valour, advised Berthelier not to attend the service. The
quarrel dragged on until 1555, when Calvin’ 's interpretation
of the Ordinance was accepted and the ‘libertine’ leaders
fled to Berne. Calvin was henceforth secure.
One external circumstance helped him. Geneva was the
natural refuge for French Protestants fleeing from persecution.
The French Protestants looked to Geneva for leadership;
and many refugees who came into Geneva were new
supports for Calvin. In 1546 not a single pastor out of
thirteen was of Genevan origin. ‘Good-bye Geneva,’ said
one of the men who hated Calvin: ‘In the end the King of
France will be a citizen here.’ The refugees were godly folk
who had left their homes for conscience sake; every new=
comer from France or Scotland or Italy or the Netherlands
or England strengthened Calvin’s hand. It was the Scottish
refugee John Knox who called Geneva ‘the mostperfectschool
of Christ that ever wason earth since the days of the Apostles’.

But it would be wrong to suppose that his authority was
based upon external support. Not even all the refugees were
content with what they found. Clément Marot, almost a
poet laureate in Paris, a gay romantic epigrammatic
Frenchman, once imprisoned for eating erroneously in
Lent, once compelled to abjure Protestant heresy, published in 1541 metrical translations of thirty psalms. A
metrical psalter was the chief vehicle of congregational worship in all the Reformed churches. Marot fled to Geneva,
and there translated twenty more psalms, to which Calvin
wrote a preface; and soon the congregations were singing
them. Marot’s poetry perfectly fitted the need of the Re«
formed. Metrical psalms afforded a new way of heartfelt
expression in worship, and were soon beloved. But Marot’s
lively person was not well suited to Geneva. In December
1543 the consistory accused a man of playing tric-trac with
him, and he left the city.

The true source of Calvin’s authority was in himself.
Uncompromising though he might be, he pursued with a
single mind what he believed to be the truth; he extorted
that reluctant admiration and discipleship which is given
to consistency, to courage, and to decisiveness. He always
spoke and wrote with a magisterial force, knew what he
wanted and where he was going, was as devoid of pomp or
cant as of sentimentality. He impressed Geneva with the
stamp of his mind; and therefore the Calvinists, wherever
they went, shared a coherence and clarity: of outlook not
shared by Lutherans, Anabaptists, or Anglicans.

In 1559 he founded a college for the higher education of
Geneva and of western Protestantism. He staffed it with
professors resigned from a similar college at Lausanne, who
could not get their city council to agree to the right of excommunication, and placed one of them at its head, the
scholar Theodore Beza, later his own successor. It rapidly
became one of the great schools of Protestant thought,
educating many of the Calvinist leaders of the second
generation. The rector, professors, and all the teachers were
appointed by the consistory, though with the approval of
the council. At first all students were made to subscribe a
rigid confession of orthodoxy; but this was abolished in
1576, partly because it excluded those who most needed
instruction and partly because it seemed to excuse Lutheran
colleges when they forced Calvinist students to sign the
Confession of Augsburg.

Calvin’s wider influence rested upon the clarity of his
theological system and of his Biblical exposition, The first
edition of the Institutes, published in 1536, was a little book
distinguished among theological performances mainly by
the: lucidity of the arrangement and the Latin style. The
book grew year by year — he had leisure to extend it in exile
at Strasbourg and allowed the first French translation of
this longer edition to be published in 1541. The final and
further extended edition was published in 1559; Calvin
from a bed of sickness dictating the French translation to his
secretaries and even then suggesting additions which might
be incorporated into the text. He wrote simply and briefly.
There are none of the reverberations of Bucer’s prose, none
of the vehemence of Luther’s. Men might not like what
Calvin said; they could not misunderstand what he meant.
And as the structure was built from edition to edition, it
became clear that the handbook, as extended at Strasbourg,
already contained the skeleton of the building and that the
additions were illustrating and amplifying and applying to
practical circumstances a theology clear to his own mind
from the first edition. But in the provision for ministry and
organization — the section of the book most momentous in
practice — the additions are substantial.

Like all minds of power, he depended upon the influence
of others and upon his past experience. The more we know
of Bucer, the more evidently derivative are certain characteristic views of Calvin upon theology and church government. But though his stay at Strasbourg under Bucer had
been formative, he was no imitator. A man of the Bible
and a hard student of the ancient Fathers, he thought and
digested and absorbed until the resulting and decisive convictions were his own.

The doctrine of Calvin rested upon a faith in God’s special
providence guiding the particular events of the world. We
are not to think of a general guidance. We are taught by the
Bible of his particular guidance in the particular events of
individual lives. We read that not a sparrow falls to the
ground without the will of the Father. We read that he
sent forth a whirlwind in the wilderness, and thus we know
that ‘no wind ever blows unless he has specially commanded’. We read that he has given babies to some mothers
and withheld them from others. This is not fatalism, no
mechanical system of a relentless nature, but the personal
decrees of an Almighty God. He moves the wills and inclinations of men to walk in the way which he directs. Chance
is an appearance to us because his eternal counsel is hidden
within his breast.

Luther’s ultimate religious act was an utter trust in a
redeeming Saviour, his ultimate text ‘the just shall live by
faith’. Calvin’s ultimate religious act was the assent of the
wil to an everlasting Lord; his ultimate text, ‘thy will be
done’.

If the circumstances are friendly, the Christian will give
all the glory to God and none to himself. If the circumstances are unfriendly and ruin afflicts him, he will recognize
the chastening of God and ery with Job “The Lord gave and
the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the
Lord’. The Biblical texts of resignation and of confidence
were frequently upon Calvin’s lips;and no one in Christian
history has had better right than the Calvinist to use them,

With this religious interest in the providence of God,
Calvin surrounded the old doctrine of predestination with a
new atmosphere.

The Protestants had been taught by Luther, by St
th Augustine, and by the Epistle to the Romans that they
fi could not deserve heaven, that the Christian moral life and
its consequences hereafter were to be accepted through
i faith as.a gift of God’s mercy and love. God chose some and
not others — Scripture taught it, and observation confirmed it.

If all is a gift of God, even the faith by which we appropriate the gift, then from all eternity God must have chosen
some to life and bestowed mercy upon them, and left others
unredeemed from their sins to die an eternal death, Every
one ‘confessed that this was probing the mystery of an
eternal Being hidden from human eyes, Everyone ‘agreed
that what the congregations needed to hear was not speculation about the mystery of predestination but ‘whosoever repents will be saved’. That predestination was a reality was
admitted by all the Christian thinkers of the Pauline
and Augustinian tradition. The _theoretical_ differences between Calvin or Augustine or St Thomas Aquinas or Luther
are small,

But Calvin saw it in the context of his faith in providence.
‘Therefore it possessed for him an importance for religious
devotion and practice which it had not possessed for Aquinas
nor even for Luther. John Eck had written about predestination as an intellectual exercise to train his youthful mind.
Calvin abhorred the notion that this was a detached problem for the mind. The Christian’s assurance of his election
to eternal life was the deepest source of his confidence, his
fearlessness, his humility, and his moral power. ‘If God be
for us, who shall be against us? The doctrine, though a
mystery, was not a mere mystery for the critics of the lecture
room. There were texts about it in the Epistles to the
Romans and the Ephesians and elsewhere in the Bible,
These texts must have been given that they might convey
knowledge, they must be preached from the pulpit and
taught to simple people. Every soul should be led in faith to
be conscious of his calling, assure himself that God’s merciful hand was upon him, until with St Paul he could profess
himself persuaded that nothing could separate him from the
love of God.

In proclaiming this majestic doctrine Calvin stripped
from it the whispering hesitations of his predecessors. He
could write nothing obscurely — and therefore he wrote
plainly the aweful (horribile) consequences: that Christ died
on the cross not for all mankind, but only for the elect; that
God does not will all men to be saved; that men ‘were
created by God whom he decreed from all eternity to be
consigned to an eternal destruction. And if. anyone cavilled
that God was thereby unjust, he replied that all men are
justly condemned for their sins, and beyond that we cannot
ae ue i parroee! We know that God always acts
in Justice, How that justice works is beyond our sight in
this life.

For the next hundred years this was the key question for
theologians, for the Catholics almost as much as for the
Protestants — the question whether the Augustinian doctrines in this uncompromising expression were the true
interpretation of the New Testament/ 'I am _not_  
predestined,’ declared the younger Berthelier violently,
‘whatever you and your Calvin say!”

The case of the ex-Carmelite Jerome Bolsec at Geneva is
the prototype of a series of controversies which were to disturb Christendom. In October 1551 one of Calvin’s colleagues explained the text of John 8.47 upon Calvinist
lines, Bolsec, a refugee from France, rose to challenge the
contention that Christ died not for all and that faith was a
gift settled from eternity upon the elect; he said that these
doctrines turned God into a tyrant. While he was speaking
Calvin entered the meeting unseen and listened. When Bolsec ended Calvin rose and spoke for an hour. Bolsec was
sent to prison. The city council, puzzled by the argument of
both sides, and not readily attracted by Calvin’s exposition,
appealed to the other churches of Switzerland, Calvin found
the answers of the other churches unsatisfactory: Berne
replied that the matter was a mystery over which men
‘should not fight; Basle and Zurich, gave a general and yet
qualified support to Calvin; and Zurich blamed Calvin for
his method of dealing with Bolsec. Only Farel’s Neuchatel,
unsolicited, sent a letter denouncing Bolsec as an Iscariot.

The city council banished Bolsec, more for the sake of peace
than for the sake of truth, Bolsec had his revenge by publishing (1577) a life of Calvin which is the source of several
scandalous legends.

In the long run this was to be the stumbling-block of
Calvinism. At first the organizing power and the doctrine
of the Church was the attractive force, Men were not drawn
by Calvinist teaching and thereby led to organize themselves as Calvinist churches. They were drawn by the Calvinist discipline and thereby led to Calvinist orthodoxy. But
the moral and devotional power in the doctrine of election
was mighty. The Calvinists were austere, fearless, hardworking, devout men of the Bible. They knew what they
believed, they knew what they must do, and they knew by
what authority they must do it. For a hundred years they
were the most potent religious force in Protestantism.
