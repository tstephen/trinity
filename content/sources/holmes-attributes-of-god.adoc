## Introduction

Perhaps no doctrine of theology is more ubiquitous than that of the divine
attributes or perfections. It is possible to receive, and perhaps, given a liturgy to
follow, even to celebrate, the eucharist without any theological understanding of
what is being deone—although it will hardly be an honouring celebration in the
latter case. It is certainly—gloriously—possible to be redeemed without any notion
of redemption. At times it has been proposed that Christians should restrict their
language to biblical terms and so refuse to engage in Christological or trinitarian
theology. (This procedure was seriously proposed as a way through the fourthcentury trinitarian controversies, and has occasionally been revived since the
Reformation by radical Protestant and Free Church groups wary of any dependence on tradition.) It is, however, impossible to speak about or to God without
some commitment concerning the divine attributes, A sentence that begins
'God is...) praise that asserts 'Lord, you are...' or intercession that pleads some
aspect of the character of God (shave mercy, Lord, for you are...') all already
betray a doctrine of the divine perfections. That a word (e.g., 'good') is held to be
a more adequate continuation of each of these statements than other possible
words (e.g., 'bad', 'morally indifferent') is a theological commitment.

Abraham pleads the perfections of God over the cities of the plain: 'Shall not the
Judge of all the earth do what is just?" (Gen. 18: 25). The highest praises, and the
deepest laments, of the psalmists alike turn on recalling before God his attributes:
"Great is the Lorn, and greatly to be praised; his greatness is unsearchable. ... On the
glorious splendour of your majesty... Iwill meditate. ... They shall celebrate the fame
of your abundant goodness, and shall sing aloud of your righteousness. ... The Lorp
is gracious and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love' (Ps. 145: 3-8);
'Has his steadfast love ceased for ever? ... Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has he in
anger shut up his compassion?' (Ps. 77: 8-9). In just these few verses it is proclaimed
that God is just, righteous, great, majestic, abundantly good, gracious, merciful,
steadfast in love, slow to anger, compassionate; the task of a doctrine of God's
perfections is to bring some order to such exuberant and heartfelt exclamations.

That the issue is ubiquitous does not make it easy, of course. There are at least
five problems in this task:

1. There is an issue of _derivation_. How do we decide which words are appropriate completions of the sentence 'God is. ..'? 'Good' might seem easy, but
terms like 'wrathful' or 'impassible' have generated extended and heated
debate in recent decades.

2. There is an issue of span. 'God is good' presumably does not say everything
Christian theologians would wish to say about God. How many words are
necessary before we may claim that the list displays some measure of
comprehensiveness? The Westminster Shorter Catechism defines God as 'a
Spirit, infinite, eternal, and unchangeable, in his being, wisdom, power,
holiness, justice, goodness, and truth, which Charles Hodge asserts is 'the
best definition of God ever penned by man' (Hodge 1960: i. 367). Is Hodge
right? On what criteria might the question be decided?

3. There is a problem of analogy. | may well find myself affirming in prayer one
morning that 'God is good', and then in conversation soon afterwards affirming
of a certain undergraduate student that she is also 'good', and perhaps of a
cricketer in the headlines that he is 'very good'. 'Good' in each context carries a
discernibly different meaning: the cricketer demonstrates finely honed physical
ability and coolness under pressure; the student shows academic promise; and
God—what does 'good' mean when applied to God? Clearly something different from the two other uses in the example, but is it something different from
every use with a human being as a referent? This seems likely: of which of the
saints will it be said 'she is good in exactly the same way that God is good"? But if
this is so, how does any meaning attach to the word 'good' when applied to God?

4. There is a philosophical problem of definition. Is it appropriate to call God
'good' because there is some external standard of goodness against which we
may measure God? If so, does this not suggest that there is something greater
than God, which stands in judgement over him? But if not, does 'good' mean
anything at all—is it not just an empty cipher we choose to apply to God,
when we apparently could have as easily and appropriately chosen 'evil'?

5. There is a historical problem concerning the relationship of certain divine
attributes to other areas of theology. Briefly stated, there are a class of attributes
(including impassibility, simplicity, and immutability) that were until about
1800 held to be necessary to orthodox accounts of the Trinity, the incarnation,
and the atonement. Since then, it has been widely assumed and argued by
both philosophers and theologians that such attributes are in fact in straight
contradiction with trinitarian theology, Christology, and soteriology.

These five issues will give shape to the account of the divine perfections in this chapter,

## THE QUESTION OF DERIVATION

How may we discover words that are adequate to the task of naming God? Here
immediately we come face to face with what will be the core problem of this chapter,
If we were to ask the historical question, 'prior to 1800, how were such words
discovered in Christian theology?' the answer is surprisingly easy. One method
dominates, the method of the viae (ways), and it is found in embryonic form in
the fathers of both East and West, in developed form in the great medieval Catholic
summae, and virtually unchanged in the Lutheran and Reformed school dogmatics
of the seventeenth century. God, on this account, is utter perfection, the summum
bonum, or 'the absolute' in more modern language. Therefore to discover what may
be truly said about God, one attributes to him every discernable good to the highest
possible degree, and denies of him completely every discernable limitation.

The former procedure is the via eminentiae, the 'way of eminence' Potency, the
ability to act, is a discernable good in human life, as is knowledge. God, therefore, must
be as potent as it is possible to be, 'omnipotent', and as knowing as it is possible to be,
'omniscient. The latter procedure is the via negativa, or 'negative way'. The inevitable
ending of human existence is perceived to be a bad thing, which we would be better
without. Therefore, God is understood to be 'immortal. A consideration of spatial
limitation, or finitude, might be held to teach us that God is 'infinite'. To these must be
added a third 'way', the via causalitatis, or 'way of causality', in which it is assumed that
effects demonstrate something of their cause, and so a knowledge of creation can lead
us to a knowledge of God. As St Thomas Aquinas argued, every change is caused by a
prior change, and so tracing the causal chain back one reaches either an infinite
regression, which he takes to be impossible, or 'at some first cause of change not itself
being changed by anything, which he identifies with God (ST u. 2, 3, in Aquinas 1975).

I have quoted St Thomas, but St John of Damascus' codification of the tradition
of the Greek fathers or Francis Turretin's Reformed polemics would both witness to
the same method. As I have indicated, however, around 1800 there is a radical shift
in approach to the question. It is difficult to find a theologian (as opposed to a
philosopher of religion) in the twentieth century who would accept such a method.
For an eloquent and forceful statement of the objections, we might turn to Emil
Brunner. In his Christian Doctrine of God, he suggests that there is 'an actual
jon between two ideas of God, which...cannot be combined..., the
ilosophical and speculative Idea of God on the one hand, and on the other, one
which is based upon the thought of God in revelation' (Brunner 1949: 241-2). The
God of Abraham and the God of the philosophers are alien, and great harm is done by
any attempt to bring them together.

That such an attempt was made, and was so enormously influential, is traced to
two causes: the unreflective but disastrous adoption of methods of Greek philosophy
by the church fathers and the enormous influence in later centuries of the writings of
Pseudo-Dionysius. (This corpus is now fairly universally believed to date from the
fifth century; however, the medievals tended to assume it was by the Dionysius who
was converted by Paul in Athens (Acts 18), and so had almost apostolic authority.)
The task for theology today is to perform or complete the criticism of Greek
philosophy and so to purge the Christian account of divine attributes of those claims
about God that lack theological warrant. I have followed Brunner in this criticism,
but to indicate its ubiquity amongst recent theologians, it may be found in extreme
form in Jenson (1997-9: i, esp. 9-11, 112-13, 131-3, 153), Moltmann (1974; 1981), and
Gunton (2002); and in measured form in Barth (1957: 329-30) and Pannenberg
(2971). This is also, of course, a part of the standard feminist criticism of traditional
Christian doctrines of God.

If such criticism can be bracketed for a moment, it may be asked whether the
method of the viae is retrievable. As I described it above, two problems are evident,
but they may provide each other's solution, First, this appears to be a doctrine of God
derived quite apart from revelation, an exercise entirely in natural theology. The
procedure as described could be practised without difficulty by one who had never
opened the biblical text or heard the name of Jesus Christ. This, of course, is not a
logical problem (it does not make the position incoherent), and, indeed, in recent
years it has been seen as a strength, rendering a doctrine of God that is generally
rationally accessible and so open to philosophical investigation without worrying
about difficult concepts such as revelation or faith. This philosophical procedure has
become known as 'perfect being theology, and has given rise to a number of works
exploring the logical coherence of a God who is held to exhibit every human virtue
maximally, and to be completely free of every human weakness.

However philosophically attractive such a procedure, it is fair to say that a
doctrine of God built without reference to scripture or the gospel is going to
appear odd theologically, to say the least, so this remains my first problem. The
second lies in the smuggled premiss in each of the three ways: the first two rely on
assumptions that we know which aspects of human existence are positive, and
which are limitations (Clark Pinnock (2001) makes the point provocatively with a
book title, Most Moved Mover). The third relies on the assumption that good
logical arguments can be made from the nature of effects to their cause.

Given this, might we claim that the smuggled knowledge in the via eminentiae and
the via negativa is precisely the place where accounts of revelation become decisive?
That is, we know what is a good, and so must be predicated eminently of God, and
what isa limitation, and so must be denied of God, only through a study of scripture,
or through a telling of the story of Jesus, or however else we might choose to describe
revelation. Consider such attributes as mercy, compassion, or humility: it is not
difficult to point to ethical traditions in history or across the world that deny that
such things are goods, yet Christian theology has wanted to ascribe each word to God
on the basis of what is revealed in the Bible and, in particular, in the gospel story.
If the question concerning the influence of Greek philosophy can be adequately
answered, this procedure would seem to provide a logically sound and theologically
satisfying account of the derivation of the divine attributes.

(The problem with the via causalitatis reduces very simply to a set of questions
concerning natural theology. If there happen to be well-formed logical arguments
that move from details of the created order to facts about the creator, then natural
theology is possible and will contribute in part to the doctrine of the divine
perfections. I presently believe that there are no such arguments—I think the
doctrine of creatio ex nihilo necessarily denies their existence—and so tend to the
view that the via causalitatis is a dead end.)

I will argue by the end of this chapter that the problem concerning Greek
philosophy can be solved, but it is perhaps worth pausing to ask about the derivation
of the divine perfections if it cannot. The answers provided by the critics are
surprisingly unified, differing only in detail. The perfections become in one way or
another descriptions of God's relationship to the world, rather than descriptions of
God's own life in se. The more extreme version of this tends to suggest that God's
own life is somehow defined in his relationship to the world (so Jenson or Moltmann); this has the merit of coherence but is an unacceptable move. The more
cautious version appears to suggest that God indeed has, or could have had, a life
apart from the world, but that this life is not properly described as 'holy' or 'good' 'In
Himself, however, God is not the Almighty, the Omniscient, the Righteous One; this
is what He is in relation to the world which he has created' (Brunner 1949: 247;
cf, Pannenberg 1991-8: i. 359-70). This is an equally difficult conclusion.

### THE QUESTION OF 'SPAN'

Even if we have adequately answered the question of definition and can demonstrate that 'love' and 'holiness' are words adequate to God, to speak only
of God's love with no mention of God's holiness—or, indeed, to speak only of
God's holiness with no mention of God's love--seems to speak improperly.
This is the question of 'span'. If the task is to find language adequate to speak of
God, then it is not just that the language chosen must refer adequately, it must also
demonstrate some degree of comprehensiveness.

Of course, no one has ever 'comprehended' that light which shines in the
darkness (John 1: 5), but the limitations of a doctrine of divine perfections is a
matter for the next section. One may meaningfully aim at adequacy, at an account
that is at least not obviously lopsided or incomplete and that points towards each
facet of the character of God revealed in the biblical witness. One could make two
lists of words traditionally attributed to God of the same length, where one was
manifestly less adequately comprehensive than the other. Consider, for instance,
the two claims, 'God is holy, just, righteous, jealous, and unchanging; and 'God is
holy, loving, righteous, merciful, and unchanging.

'An examination of the history of attempts to list the perfections of God, particularly in the Protestant scholastics, suggests that one particular procedure has regularly been adopted by theologians aiming at comprehensiveness: the splitting of the
attributes into two classes. In Reformed dogmatics these are generally described as
'communicable' and 'incommunicable' attributes. Quite apart from the echoes of
Reformed-Lutheran polemics over the communicatio idiomatum, such language is
perhaps unhappy in suggesting an inability on God's part. Nonetheless, the intention
is right: God has graciously and sovereignly chosen that his creatures will image forth
or share certain perfections of his being, whereas others he has sovereignly and
graciously chosen to retain as marks of his majesty alone. 'Thus creatures may love,
but no creature is infinite; some creatures are made holy by God, but no creature is
immutable. The attributes are thus not 'communicable' and 'incommunicable' so
much as 'communicated' and 'uncommunicated.

It may seem that this distinction relates directly to the distinction between the via
eminentiae and the via negativa described above, but this is not in fact the case. To take
only one example, God has chosen to create the angels immortal, at least according to
classical Christian dogmatics. (Many writers also assert that angels are spiritual, Le.
unembodied, which would be another example of an attribute derived from the via
negativa which nonetheless appears to be communicable; this point is disputed in the
tradition, however.) Some scholastic writers did in fact use 'positive' and 'negative'
attributes as their twofold distinction, thus aligning precisely with the viae.

Other language that has been used to describe the two classes includes 'personal'
and 'absolute'. While this is superficially attractive, in that words such as 'ove' or
'holiness' seem more obviously 'personal' than words like 'eternity' or 'immutability,
it seems to me even more unhappy, not least in its echoes of technical
trinitarian language. If some perfections of God are labelled 'personal', then there
will be an inevitable pressure to align them to the trinitarian persons in ways that
the 'impersonal' attributes are not aligned. 'Absolute' and 'relative' has a similar
flaw, both echoing 'relation' language in the Trinity and perhaps suggesting that
God is 'eternal' in himself but 'loving' only in relation to the creation. Barth
chooses to describe the two classes as 'perfections of God's love' and 'perfections
of God's freedom'; this echoes his fundamental definition of God throughout
Church Dogmatics l1/1 as 'the One who loves in freedony (Barth 1957: 257). Barth
offers good reasons for his decision, but the language appears in danger of. suggesting
that 'love' and 'freedom are the controlling perfections of God, under which all
else must be arranged. The same might be said of Pannenberg's opting for 'infinity'
and 'love'—indeed, Pannenberg claims centrality for 'infinity' as an attribute of
God (Pannenberg 1991-8: i. 396). As will be seen, there are good dogmatic reasons
to refuse to promote any of the perfections above the others.

It will be noted, however, that all these different forms of twofold division have a
similar intention, even ifat the margins one perfection or another might fall on either
side of the line depending which schema we choose. There are those perfections of
God for which an analogue may be found in the creature, and those which are utterly
beyond anything in our experience. The 'positive' attributes, the 'perfections of God's
loving} the 'communicated' perfections, refer to aspects of God's nature that may be
hinted at through human stories ('out of pity for him, the lord of that slave released
him and forgave him....And in anger his lord handed him over....So my heavenly The classical answer to such questions has been some form of a doctrine of
Father will also do to every one of you'; Matt. 18: 23-35). The 'negative' attributes,
the 'perfections of God's freedom', the 'uncommunicated' perfections, refer to aspects of
God's nature about which we can only speak by denying that certain facets of our
common experience can be mapped in any way onto God ('God is not a human being,
that he should lie, or a mortal, that he should change his mind'; Num. 23: 19).

  7 analogy. The standard discussion is again in St Thomas Aquinas, q. 13 of the
Summa Theologiae. Thomas insists that human words are used positively and
literally of God, and goes on to ask how this is the case. He distinguishes three
possible uses of words: the univocal use, in which a word is used in precisely the
claim to be expounding.) |

The further question of 'span' might appear more linguistic than theological. finguistic issue, and there is a further theologi cal issue. The Kinguistic issue concerns the semantic ranges of words. If we describe God as 'just', we use a word that
jn English is patient of a variety of different meanings; the extent to which it
— lluminates or obscures the use of other words such as the Latin iustus, the Greek
dikaios, or the Hebrew tsaddiq is a matter of some theological controversy. There is
a need, therefore, to specify the precise nuance of meaning intended. This, however, immediately raises a theological issue. It seems theologically necessary to
assert the uniqueness of God, that there is no creature that is good or loving in
precisely the same way as God, and so such words must be used with a semantic

 

range that is unique. How, though, may such a unique semantic range possibly be
jdentified or specified?

(Returning for a moment to perfect-being theology, the widespread failure to
struggle with questions of analogy is one of the weaknesses of the movement.
Phrases such as 'whatever else it may mean, omniscience must at least imply...' are
very common and suggest a lack of engagement with the serious apophaticism of
the very writers—Anselm, Thomas, etc.—that perfect-being theologians generally

The further question of 'span' might appear more linguistic than theological. 7 the equivocal use, in which a word is used in different senses in different statements
Assuming that we can argue that God may properly be described as both 'merciful > ('the blues' as a musical form bear no discernable relation to the colour, for
and 'loving, there is perhaps a question as to whether one needs, in writing a : example); and the analogical use, in which a word is used in similar but separable
theology of the perfections of God, to include the word 'merciful' alongside the senses in different statements ('the blues' as a musical form and 'the blues' as a
word 'loving, or whether the latter word covers all the semantic ground necessary psychic state, describing a mild depression, would seem to have some similarity of
and so effectively includes the former. This is more than a linguistic issue, however, meaning, in that the musical form seems particularly suited to expressing the
and in fact gets near to the heart of any doctrine of the divine perfections, in that = psychic state). Thomas claims that the words we use to name God are analogous
it asks both what words mean when attributed to God, and how the different = to the same words used of created realities. God is truly, and primarily, 'good'
attributes of God are in fact related to each other. To these issues I now turn. Jj (Thomas insists on the primacy of the divine meaning in ST sa, 13, 6); as such, God

is the cause of all goodness in creatures, and so when we speak of a creature
being 'good' we are using an analogous term, suggesting that the partial

discussed above. It is even arguable that Thomas did this. His doctrine of analogy,

and limited goodness of creatures is similar to, if not the same as, God's primary
and infinite goodness.

### THE QUESTION OF ANALOG
 
Our language—all our language—is inadequate to the task of speaking of God.
Even when we refer to those perfections that we call 'positive' or 'communicable' or
'communicated', we are always using language that is doubly difficult. There is a

however, is fundamentally a claim about how words applied to God may be said to

have some positive meaning; it applies without distinction to a claim based on
straight biblical citation—God is love—and to a claim based on some form of
natural theology.)

Generally, the notion that words are used of God and creatures analogously has
been accepted; some interesting arguments have arisen over the necessary basis of
such analogy, but they do not dispute the general point that words are used

analogically. John Duns Scotus, for instance, suggested that analogy necessarily |

collapses into equivocation unless there exists some underlying univocal concept,
He therefore suggested that for any communicated perfection of God—goodness,
say—three distinguishable concepts were present: goodness simpliciter, which is
univocal; divine goodness, which is goodness simpliciter held in the most perfect
degree; and creaturely goodness, which is goodness simpliciter in a limited and
imperfect form. Divine goodness and creaturely goodness can then be held to be
analogous. Such an account seems in danger of denying the primacy and priority of
God's goodness, whatever logical gains are made. Pannenberg agrees with Scotus'
critique, insisting that the basic point about analogy relying on an underlying
univocity has never been effectively answered, although he notes the influence of
recent linguistic theories in this regard. His own procedure, however, merely uses
an appeal to the history of concepts and the way language has been used in faith
communities to make the same sort of point as Thomas does using analogy
(Pannenberg 1991-8: i. 384-96).

Even if we leave to one side such questions and accept the use of analogy, this
only solves half the problem, and what is, theologically, the less interesting half
God's goodness is, on Thomas's account, the primary reality of which all creaturely =
goodness is but a limited, partial, and inexact analogy. Does this help us to specify
what is meant by the assertion 'God is good'?

Here an appeal to the particular shape of revelation is necessary. The Bible is not,
essentially, composed of propositions such as 'God is good', although it is certainly
not without them. Rather, its essential form is narrative, together with a significant ©
number of prayers addressed to God and paraenetic material exploring what life —
pleasing to God might look like in various contexts. If all we had were a series of
assertions that God is good, loving, holy, etc., then it might be difficult to give —
content to those words. If, however, we can combine a claim that God is good with
such narratives, prayers, and commands, then there is a possibility of recognition.
In narrative history we can see ways in which this God has acted, ways which
resonate with our experiences of human goodness; we can hear prayers that appeal
to something we can identify with our own knowledge of what it is to love; we can
be confronted by commands that bring to mind accounts of created holiness. Thus
we may begin to understand what true goodness, love, and holiness—the goodness,
love, and holiness of God of which our experiences are only pale shadows—might
look like.

### THE QUESTION OF DEFINITION

In his _Euthyphro_, Plato has Socrates asking whether an act is pious because it is loved
by the gods, or whether it is loved by the gods because it is pious. Transposed into
Christian theology, the question becomes pressing, and gives rise to one of the most
controversial areas of the classical doctrine of the perfections of God.

When we say 'God is good', it seems that we must either be claiming that the
word 'good' is merely a cipher we choose to apply to God's actions (and 'wicked'
would have done just as well), or that we are asserting that there is a standard of
goodness somewhere in existence against which we may measure God. In medieval
theology, the two sides of the debate became known as 'nominalism"' and 'realism':
jn the first case, 'good' is merely a name (Latin nomen); in the second case, 'good' is
something real. On the one hand, it seems that God may be capricious, unaccountable (if nominalism were correct, how could Abraham demand, 'Shall not the Judge
of all the earth do what is just'?); on the other, it seems that God is subject to
something beyond himself. It seems that neither position is acceptable.

There is a relatively straightforward logical solution to this problem, which has
recently been the subject of much theological, and indeed philosophical, controversy.
It is the assertion that God is simple. 'Simplicity' in this context is the property of
being uncompounded and so without parts. If God is simple, then his goodness
cannot be meaningfully distinct from his essence (because if it were God would be
compound in some sense), and so God's goodness is in fact God himself.

Such a claim has two interesting consequences. First, it suggests that every
perfection of God is necessary for God to be who he is: if God's goodness is in
some sense identical with God himself, then God cannot be himself without being
good. Second, it provides a neat and (to my mind) convincing solution to the
Euthyphro dilemma: 'goodness' is neither merely a name we apply to God's actions
nor a standard beyond God by which he may be judged. Rather, it is God's own
character to which he may indeed be held accountable (it is precisely because he is
'Judge of all the earth' that he will do what is just). So far, so good.

The claim also has another apparent consequence, however, and if this does
follow, it is completely devastating—hence the recent controversy. It is this: if God
is simple, then God is identical to his goodness; and, if God is simple, then God is
identical to, say, his omniscience; therefore, by basic logic (if A=B and A=C, then
B=C), God's goodness is identical with God's omniscience. Such a statement
appears to be mere nonsense, and such logic has recently led many philosophers to
query the coherence of any doctrine of divine simplicity.

Such arguments must be wrong; it is hard to believe that such a trivial objection
went unnoticed by almost every Christian (ahd, incidentally, Jewish and Islamic)
theologian or philosopher of the medieval and early modern periods. Indeed, the
standard treatments make claims that stand in flat contradiction to the conclusion
of this argument. Something else must be going on, something that invalidates the
form of such arguments. Thomas, indeed, asks the question 'are all the words
'predicated of God synonymous' (ST 1a. 13, 4), raising precisely this form of
argument in the first objection. Nonetheless, on the basis of the biblical use of
divine attribution (sed contra, 'Jeremiah says, "Most strong, mighty and powerful,
the Lord of Armies is thy name""'; Jer. 32: 18), he denies that the conclusion follows,
The argument appears to go something like this: although properly God's goodness
is primary and creaturely goodness only derived, in our knowing this order is
necessarily reversed: we first know derived goodness, and from that begin to
understand what it means to call God good. We cannot know God's simple
perfection directly, but only through a series of divided and varied 'perfections'
-<of which we observe the derivative forms in creatures. Thus we give God many
-- names (good, loving, omniscient, etc.) which each refer in a partial and imperfect,
but nonetheless real, way to the single perfection of God. The sort of logical
argument I sketched above fails because 'Synonyms signify the same thing from
the same point of view. Words that signify the same thing thought of in different
ways do not, properly speaking, signify the same, for words only signify things by
way of thoughts' (ST 1a. 13, 4 ad 1).

(Again returning to perfect-being theology, questions about the doctrine of
simplicity are very widespread there, possibly because, as I have already indicated,
this tradition seems to lack any serious account of God's incomprehensibility, and
so generally assumes that the meaning of words applied to God is fairly clear. Thus
". the arguments in the paragraph above are simply missed.)

Thomas thus bases his logical defence on the philosophy of language. Poststructuralist linguistic theories will tend to lend some support to Thomas's case,
but there is perhaps another form of argument that can be deployed, one more
theologically grounded and so less open to buffeting by the winds of philosophical
fashion. Amongst the classical perfections of God is the claim that God is incomprehensible—what God is is unknowable to human minds. Such a claim seems
intuitively plausible, and a theological reading of a text such as Exodus 33: 18-22
might establish it. If God is incomprehensible, then it is at least questionable whether
we know enough to make arguments respecting his essence. Thomas continually
points out that our words signify imperfectly when applied to God; this is a result not
just of the nature of language, but also of the nature of God. (As Pannenberg
recognizes, Thomas's appeal is more to God's transcendence as the basis of his
unknowability than to his infinity; unlike Pannenberg, I regard this as a positive
feature of the account, picking up on a clear biblical theme of the otherness of God
from the creatures (Pannenberg 1991-8: i. 344).) The apparent logical difficulty
1 began with, then, is more precisely stated as an argument of the form: the
word 'good' imperfectly but really signifies the simple perfection of God; the word
'omniscient' imperfectly but really signifies the simple perfection of God; therefore
'good' and 'omniscient' mean the same thing. This looks much less convincing.

If it is logically possible to assert divine simplicity, however, the theological
propriateness of the doctrine has been severely questioned in recent years. Once
again we are back to the fundamental shift in the doctrine of the divine perfections
that occurred around the nineteenth century. The core issue becomes the relationship of a doctrine of divine simplicity to trinitarian doctrine. From Gregory of
'Nyssa's defence of the doctrine of the Trinity for Ablabius in the late fourth century
to Francis Turretin's defence against the Socinians in the late seventeenth, there was
an assumption on all sides that to believe in divine simplicity was to be an
orthodox trinitarian, and to deny simplicity was to attack the doctrine of the
Trinity; in the twentieth century it seems that writers virtually universally assume
the precise opposite: either one may continue to believe in divine simplicity, or one
may believe in the Trinity, but the two are mutually exclusive. Finally, then, this
chapter needs to deal with the core historical issue.

### The problem of history

When Walter Smith wrote his hymn 'Immortal, invisible, God only wise' in the
mid-nineteenth century, he was celebrating a vision of God that was passing. There
is no hymn more regularly condemned in theological conversation or instruction
than this one..It celebrates, undergraduates are regularly told, a pagan Greek idea of
God that thoroughly infected the Christian church and is only now, thankfully,
being driven out. The doctrine of divine perfections is emblematic of this pagan
idea in at least three ways, and so of all doctrines is most ripe for radical revision.

First, it is claimed that several standard perfections of God are in fact Greek
impositions, theologically unwarranted. God is not impassible, immutable, or
eternal, at least not in standard ways. Further, as already noted, one of the necessary
logical supports of the whole account of the divine perfections, divine simplicity, is
held to be profoundly problematic. Third, the whole doctrine, both in its methods
of derivation, and in its relative prominence compared to the 'properly Christian'
account of God as Trinity, is fundamentally compromised. If a doctrine of divine
perfections is to remain any part of Christian theology, it will be in a subordinate
place, in a chastened tone, and in a very different form.

What are the reasons for this change? There are, it seems to me, several. One has
already been noted: a historical account of the rise of Christianity that suggests
unwarranted Greek influence in formative periods. The classic account of such
history is of course in the school of Ritschl and Harnack, but it pre-dates them
(Baur's elaborate account of catholic Christianity as the triumphant outcome of a
Hegelian synthesis between Jewish and Greek roots is similar in form, although it
lacks the negative judgement on the Greek influence.) For scholars such as Ritsch}
the scientific study of the historical Jesus had seemingly confirmed that miracles
particularly the resurrection, and a fascination with things both eschatological _
(including such issues as sin and atonement) and metaphysical were not part of 
the teaching of the man from Nazareth, but later accretions. Christianity as we
know it, with sacrament and liturgy and theology, looks like a Greek mystery cult 
built on the flimsiest of historical recollection of a simple moral teacher.

Of course, such accounts have been comprehensively discredited by historical
study. They introduce a motif, however, which seems to have endured. If we
emphasize the differences between 'Jewish' and 'Greek' ways of thinking, and so
portray the early history of Christianity as a fundamentally Jewish movement
inculturating itself within a Hellenistic milieu, then we make it very easy to argue
that this or that feature of later Christianity is Hellenistic, and so non-native, and
so an inappropriate accretion that should be removed.

It is not a hard task to list the various problems with the procedure so stated; the
notion of uniform and separate cultures is merely ridiculous (one glance at Philo
disproves both parts of the thesis, even ignoring the three centuries of Macedonian
occupation of Palestine, the varieties of Graeco-Roman culture attested in history,
and the varieties of Jewish culture demonstrated by the Gospels); to argue from
'non-native feature' to 'inappropriate accretion', particularly in the case of a process
of inculturation, is merely question-begging; and so on. However, such arguments
vdo not prove that every claim of improper Greek influence is false, only that not
every such claim is true. There is a need for some hard historical and theological
work on the details of the issues, but it seems to me that the legacy of Baur, Ritschl,
and Harnack has been to create a presumption in many theologians' minds that the
arguments can be settled in one direction relatively easily. Such a presumption
needs to be challenged.

(The claimed influence of Pseudo-Dionysius noted above is a particular issue
here. Suffice to say that it is not clear that he is treated as any more of an authority
than any other church father. Looking at ST 1a. 13, for instance, it is the case that
Pseudo-Dionysius is cited more than any other father (seven direct references of the
sixteen to patristic sources; there are also nine to scripture and four to Aristotle),
but since he had written a book entirely on the subject of the question (The Divine
Names}, this might not be surprising. It is notable however that, uniquely amongst
the sources cited (apart from an isolated reference to Boethius), he is always
cited in the objections—that is, in every case Thomas takes the opposing position on the question to Pseudo-Dionysius. To suggest, as Brunner did, that Thomas
uncritically follows the earlier writer seems to fly in the face of the evidence.)

A second reason for the shift would seem to be the influence of Kantian
philosophy. I indicated above that, amongst theologians who uphold the
'Hellenizing' criticism concerning the perfections, there is a surprising
degree of unanimity on the proposition that the perfections refer not to God
_in se_, but to God's
action towards the creation. Such an account naturally brings to mind
Schleiersacher's careful account of how he understood not just the doctrine of divine
perfections but every doctrine: as a precise statement of an aspect of the basic
religious experience of humanity (Schleiermacher 1928: 76-8, 125—8). There is little
doubt that somewhere behind this particular decision is the challenge of Kant's
denial of the possibility of any knowledge of the noumenal. Theologically transposed,
Kant's arguments could easily be held to suggest that we cannot have any
knowledge of God in se, but only of God in relation to us. The continuing influence
of Kant's epistemological questioning is a part of the pressure against the classical
doctrine of the divine perfections.

For a third reason, let me return to the end of the previous section, and the question
of the relationship of the doctrine of the divine perfections to the doctrine of
the Trinity. The issue here has been a fundamental change in assumptions about
the doctrine of the Trinity, far more than any issue to do with the divine perfections.
Ifone holds, as all pre-Romantic trinitarian doctrine held, that the divine persons are
utterly one in being, will, thought, power, action—and indeed in all perfections
save only the relations of origin that distinguish them (unbegottenness, begottenness,
procession), then it is not difficult to hold Trinity and simplicity together. If one
views the three divine persons as separate centres of will, thought, and action, as
seems to have become popular in the twentieth century, then it is much more difficult.

The underlying influence here may well be Romanticism. At the heart of the
Romantic spirit is a particular emphasis on, and vision of, the notion of personhood, or personality. The essence of personhood is self-determination, and so
volition; the expression of personhood is therefore spontaneous reaction, and
so emotion; and personhood must be understood as the highest good imaginable.
Given all this, there would seem to have been strong cultural pressure both to
rewrite the doctrine of the Trinity in ways that make the three persons 'persons' in
the full Romantic sense, and to deny those aspects of the traditional perfections of
God that seemed to offend against Romantic notions of personhood. Whatever the
weaknesses of Barth's proposal to replace 'person' with 'mode of being' in technical
trinitarian discourse, it at least defended against this failing.

(On this latter point, consider how much in contemporary rejections of God's
eternity, immutability, and impassibility is explicitly motivated by rhetorical claims
concerning the supposed inability of an impassible, immutable, eternal God to be
passionate, loving, and involved in human suffering. | believe all three points to
be demonstrably false, but their prominence might be evidence for the cultural
demand that God be appropriately Romantic.)

Thus far I have tried to suggest that there are at least problems with the historical
explanation offered for why the classical account of the divine perfections went so
wrong, and to suggest that there are good reasons to suppose some of the demands
for revision are driven by cultural pressure. Neither of these is yet an argument for
truth or falsity, of course; they are attempts to shift the burden of proof slightly.
The basic appeal of most revisionist theology in this area, and the fourth and lag.
reason I can find advanced by writers who want to recast the doctrine of divin,
perfections, is exegetical. It is claimed that Smith's 'unresting, unhasting, and silen|
God is simply alien to the biblical revelation. If this is the case, then regardless o}
the historical details, the doctrine of divine perfections must be rewritten. ©
course, proponents of more traditional views throughout history have read an
appealed to the Bible, so, unless there is some decisive shift in biblical interpret.
ation which renders the more modern exegesis more convincing, this must remain :
a point of dispute which may be argued in either direction.

If Baur or Ritschl were right, of course, and we could find in the New Testament
evidence of a later Hellenizing of a simple ethical religion, then there would be a
good reason to prefer the more modern approaches. Scientific exegesis would have
revealed to us a fact of decisive importance for this discussion which Augustine,
Thomas, and Turretin could not have known. Unfortunately for such a line of
argument, there are few biblical scholars who would now accept Baur's or Ritschl's
reconstructions even in broad outline. It does seem to me, however, that recent
methods of exegesis do lend support to the revisionist case in two particulars. First,
the development of higher criticism has led to a willingness, unparalleled in
theological history, to lay aside certain texts and simply exclude them from
influencing theological work. Whilst most practitioners of such critical practices
would claim that they are applying objective canons to determine which texts
should be dismissed, more recent studies have deconstructed such claims to
objectivity to expose the smuggled assumptions which are being reinforced by —
the results of the process. The scripture principle that theology should employ will
remain controverted, but I will proceed on the basis that no text should be excluded
from the canon, and so assume that in this there is no reason to prefer the newer
ways of constructing a doctrine of the divine perfections.

The second hermeneutical strategy that seems relevant here is the rise of literary
critical approaches to the scriptures. When the Old Testament histories,
particularly, are read using the tools of literary analysis, God is revealed as
a passionate, —
involved, acting, and reacting character in the narrative, and this is regularly
invoked as evidence that the doctrine of divine perfections stands in need of _
revision. But such a procedure again involves the issue of smuggled premisses:
the categories of 'literature' and 'narrative'—even the category of 'character'-—are
derived from Romantic notions of what makes for good writing. Although medieval exegetes did not theorize so carefully, they read the histories as narratives with
Aristotle's _Poetics_--and much technical Greek historiography--in their minds, and
thus came to rather different conclusions.

So I suggest that there is no good exegetical reason to presume that more recent
exegetical claims concerning the divine perfections are more convincing than older
ones. I will end this essay with a sketch of a doctrine of the divine perfections that
highlights and addresses some of the core exegetical choices,

### The perfections of God

What God is is indeed unspeakable in human language and unknowable by human
The task, however, is to find words adequate to God. Mindful of earlier
the divine perfections, rather than insisting on particular words, I shall attempt to give
a set of 'classes' of perfections which together will indicate an adequate span for the
doctrine. Any such categorization can only be schematic, so some perfections will fit
into more than one 'class, indicating places where there is some overlap between
them. As an overarching schema for my account, I will use the twofold division above
between communicated and uncommunicated perfections. The following claims rest
on unrehearsed exegetical decisions; several of them are contentious, but the defence
of God's being properly named as 'wrathful', for instance, cannot be attempted here.

'God is love' (1 John 4: 8). For a first 'class' of communicated perfections we may
Jook to what I will call perfections of the divine condescension. God loves, God is
merciful, gracious, generous, faithful, and long-suffering. God sovereignly and freely
orientates himself towards his creatures, accepting them despite their sin and failure,
and pledging his commitment to them. Connected with these biblically would be the
claim that God is 'jealous' (a claim made repeatedly in the Torah—three times, for
instance, in Deuteronomy 4-6) and even 'wrathful: God's condescension to his
creatures implies also a set of attitudes that have as their closest created analogues
such negative emotional reactions as jealousy, anger, or hatred, directed towards all
that would damage or harm God's creation, or frustrate God's plan for his creation.

'God is a righteous judge' (Ps. 7: 11). A second class of communicated perfections
might be described as perfections of the divine governance. God rules over his
creation, and so is righteous, just, wise, steadfast, majestic, and sovereign. God
graciously and freely reigns as Lord over all that he has made; by his own choice
he is enthroned as king and judge, and he exercises these roles perfectly. Because
of this, the biblical claims that God is merciful and gracious must also be included
in this class of perfections: mercy, too, is an exercise of wise sovereignty. Finally,
governance implies insight, and so under this head we may also insist that God is
properly named as omniscient, wise, and all-seeing.

"Holy, holy, holy is the Lorp of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory' (Isa. 6: 3).
For a final class of communicated perfections, we might choose the title 'perfections
of the divine goodness. God's actions are perfect in ethical and intentional ways as
in all other ways, and so God is good, holy, righteous, pure, upright, and faithful.
Because God is these things, however, he cannot look on sin (Hab. 1: 13); therefore
God is also properly described as implacable, wrathful, terrible, and jealous.

'If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world and ail that is in it is mine'
(Ps. 50: 12). For a first class of uncommunicated perfections, we might choose the
title 'perfections of the divine self-sufficiency. God needs nothing, does not grow or
change, and is not damaged or affected by his creation. Amongst the perfections of
God, therefore, we may include aseity, impassibility, immutability, eternity,
self-sufficiency, omnipotence, freedom, and transcendence. Because God needs nothing
from the world, however, he is free to be involved within his creation, therefore
God must also be described as loving, gracious, omnipresent, and immanent.

"No one shall see me and live' (Exod. 33: 20). A second class of uncommunicated
perfections may be called 'perfections of the divine glory. The majesty of God is
such that it is unbearable to human beings, at least to unredeemed human beings,
but the vision of God remains the chief good of humankind and the deepest desire
of our hearts. God is, therefore, properly named as beautiful, glorious, terrible,
majestic, holy, and awesome.

Such a list cannot be comprehensive. Looking over it, | immediately note that
basic biblical assertions concerning the compassion (Jas. 5: 11) or spirituality John
4: 24) of God are missing. A collection of such words, each filled out by biblical
narrative and example, and all held to be not in competition but genuinely
separable and also truly united aspects of the one simple inexpressible nature of
God, is the final aim of a doctrine of the divine perfections.
