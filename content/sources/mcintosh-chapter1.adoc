## Chapter 1--How God Makes Theologians

### Astonishment and Theological Virtue

Just about the worst thing that could happen to Christian theologians is for them
to be taken too seriously. I don't mean to imply that I and my colleagues are all
farcical figures, of course. Perhaps we could be compared to children wading in
the sea: studiously cautious, not intending to get wet, but magnificently upended
by the vast, joyful rolling of the tide. The tide pulling at theologians is God, trying
to get us to float, even swim, or at least admit we have no business floundering
along on two feet in such a current.

I picture theologians this way (myself included) because we are essentially
hapless folk, ever prone to manage and clarify what remains, mercifully, beyond
our grasp. The divine currents we paddle about in — grace, for example, or forgiveness, or resurrection — are, right down to their last filaments of eternal glory,
entirely unaccountable to us, unexpected, and undeserved. The ordinary cycles of
everyday life, by contrast, are conveniently predictable; they amble amiably along
into the sleek charts and scholarly monographs in which we render them as subjects
of study. Most of us contemporary theologians, soberly trained in the best scholarly methods, try our hardest to analyze the divine realities by dutifully herding
them into the approved pens of dialectical arguments and critical studies. Yet when
we open our mouths to discourse of deity, out come skirling parables, hopelessly
impossible histories, and such reckless extravagances as the idea of a God who
refuses to stay exclusively divine, and a savior who's such a miserable failure he
cannot even save himself. As the Apostle Paul said, the whole thing seems comically weak and foolish by any human standard you like (1 Corinthians 1:
18-31).

Who can blame us if we theologians try to remain inconspicuous? The danger
is that we will attempt to blend in all too well; we will master the academic and
ecclesiastical arts so proficiently that people will not notice how outrageous is the

### Becoming a Theologian

subject of our work. We may even manage, perhaps without realizing it, to substitute for the outlandishness of Christian faith, a gray orderliness in which nothing
unexpected ever happens or ever could. But every once in a great while, theologians of such good humor and humility come along that they are content to teach
the truth about God precisely by Jetting the ludicrous inadequacies of their art
appear in broad daylight. They let the divine truth shimmer gracefully in the
soaking garments of their patiently constructed arguments, having walked through
yet another doorway with grace like a pail of water perched comically above.
That is my warning and my confession. We theologians cannot show you the
reality of grace in a proper argument. We cannot explain it according to rational
necessities. We can only gesture in what we believe is the right direction and
hope our hand waving will entice you close enough to get splashed, indeed
immersed, yourself.

This does not mean that the study of theology is a fruitless task. Like the study
of poetry or music in a university setting, academic theology can accomplish any
number of useful purposes. It should shed light on the history and forms of theologizing, on the ideas and imagery we try to compose with, on the nature and
interrelationship of the thoughts of vast swathes of humankind. But at the end of
the day these chores ought to leave one more sensitive to the truth and beauty
that beckons ungraspably from within poetry or music or theology, not earnestly
confident that one has wrestled reality to the ground. While writing one of the
most voluminous efforts in theology in human history, the Swiss theologian Karl
Barth (1886-1968) paused to remark:

Ifanyone should not find himself astonished and filled with wonder when he becomes
involved in one way or another with theology, he would be well advised to consider
once more, from a certain remoteness and without prejudice, what is involved in this
undertaking. The same holds true for any who should have accomplished the feat of
no longer being astonished, instead of becoming continually more astonished all the
time that he concerns himself with this subject. When he reconsiders the subject,
however, such a man might find that astonishment wells up within him anew, or
perhaps even for the first time. And this time such wonder might not desert him but
might rather become increasingly powerfull in him. That astonishment should remain
or become wholly foreign to him is scarcely conceivable. But should that happen,
both he and theology would fare better if he would devote his time to some other
occupation, . . . If such astonishment is lacking, the whole enterprise of even the best
theologian would canker at the roots. On the other hand, as long as even a poor
theologian is capable of astonishment, he is not lost to the fulfillment of his task."

As I have been suggesting, this recurring astonishment that theologians suffer has
everything to do with the reality they seek to understand.

By now you may be sufficiently alarmed to suffer at least some mild wonderment
yourself. You wanted an introduction to Christian theology, but so far you've been
hearing about the peculiar fate of theologians. Indeed, as you probably noticed,
I titled this crucial gateway chapter, "How God Makes Theologians." Why? What
is it about theology that requires such attention to the impact its subject matter
has upon its students? After all, studying the properties of chemical compounds
doesn't turn you into the chemicals you are studying, nor do we imagine that such
a metamorphosis would greatly assist the process of understanding. The trouble
and astonishment of theology is that something like this does (or at least, potentially, can) happen in its case. A mysterious affinity kindles between theology's
object and theologians. As this happens, theologians start to catch glimpses of
reality, shimmering and beckoning far beyond the proper frames and disciplines
of theology itself. Like children playing at the water's edge, theologians find
themselves tugged by the tide and tumbled by waves that delight and lure them
deeper. Of course, scholars in many disciplines find themselves enraptured by their
objects of study. This certainly happens (or should happen!) in theology also, but
I'm afraid there is something yet more unsettling going on.

Consider, by analogy, the difference between studying the chemical composition
of a rock and studying the psychology of a human person. It's true that in both
cases good scholars will grow fascinated by their objects of study, and devoted to
the truth about them that they are seeking to discover and understand. Really
great scholars might even speak about trying to learn from the rock or the human
person, about letting the object of study become, in a sense, their teacher. But
this is clearly going to be quite different in the two cases. The rock will speak only
by means of an enigmatic silence, benign but undeniably stony. But the human
person will be a much more active participant in the work: not simply filling out
forms corresponding to the scholar's research template, but perhaps interrupting,
correcting, transforming through conversation everything the scholar may have
thought were the real data.

And what if the person you were studying had especially peculiar habits, like
severe sleepwalking or refusing to talk with you except over gargantuan meals of
fresh mussels in which you were required to partake? Pretty soon, if you really
wanted to understand, you might begin to develop new habits yourself — allowing
you to study your sleepwalking mussel-eater more adroitly and naturally. At first,
you would tell yourself, 'm not really a nocturnal person and I don't really like
mollusks of any kind whatsoever. Yet there you are, every evening, gorging with
your research subject on mussels and trailing along a few hours later through the
darkness on the nightly ramble. What has happened? You have become, at least
for study purposes, a learner, an apprentice to the object of your study — who has
in fact become your teacher. And for a while at least, you have acquired something
of a new way of being, new habits of existence that fit you for your study encounters. We could call these new habits your sleepwalking mussel-eater research
virtues; they are the dispositions that allow you a certain flourishing and even
excellence as a student of sleepwalking mussel-eaters.

But now suppose that your research subject were even more peculiar still.
Suppose that as you drew near, this person, astonishingly, told you the truth about
yourself: both the truth you had been afraid to admit and a yet deeper truth you
had never known but always longed to hear. Suppose this person was so available
for you, so vulnerably honest and self-disclosing, and showed such fidelity towards
your own work, that you began to develop a high degree of faith in the person's
essential goodness and reliability. Over time, such a research subject might engender a fair portion of both humility and hope within you, a sense that your study
would indeed take you somewhere wonderful and real. And suppose that over
time you began to catch glimpses of your research subject helping others with
such generosity and breathtaking selflessness that you began to be inspired yourself, feeling a kindred sort of love for people, and gradually finding yourself able
to converse with your subject more freely, to understand more deeply, as you
yourself began to sense something of this passion your subject had for others. In
such a case, you would indeed be studying by a kind of apprenticeship, with your
subject as your true teacher. Moreover, the research virtues that would have begun
to grow in you — those habits equipping you to succeed in just being around and
understanding this person — these virtues would have truly begun to transform
you. Faith, and hope, and love taking root in you would point to a remarkable
subject of study.

Thomas Aquinas (¢.1225-74) calls such habits the "theological virtues," for
they turn out to equip one to participate in a theological life, a life of theo-logia,
of speech and meaning and truth about God and, astonishingly, with God (see
Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologiae \-I1, question 62). These dispositions are the
making of theologians; for they are the impact this subject (God) has upon those
who draw near. As Thomas puts it, these theological virtues are the way God's
life re-creates a human life as that human life partakes in God's life: "as kindled
wood partakes of the nature of fire."?

So this is why it's worth talking a bit about what makes a theologian — because
it offers us a glimpse of the "research subject" who makes such an impression on.
the theologian (indeed, a subject who is in the researcher like fire is in wood,
according to Thomas Aquinas). We notice that, unlike having a rock or a sleepwalking mussel-eater as a research subject, the theologian is trying to engage with
someone who seems to be supremely free, whose mystery is only available to the
researcher by an act of free self-disclosure that is most likely to be visible in the
peculiar influence it has upon the researcher. This subject is not like a lab specimen
or even someone you can coax into the research program with the promise ofa
free meal. That's probably what makes theologians seem so hapless sometimes.
The deepest truth of the one they seek to understand is only expressible, sometimes, in the transformations of their own lives.

Where do we get this idea that trying to understand God is going to have such
a strange impact on people? From the same Paul the Apostle who said the truth
of God seems foolish by human standards. Paul considers the variety of ways that
early followers of Jesus express their common life, and he wonders about the
leading impulses and gifts they each manifest. He thinks this gifted, transforming,
communal life is in fact an ongoing organic expression of Jesus continuing life in
the world, constantly being brought to life by what Paul calls the Spirit. This
means that the habits and virtues and gifts of the Christian community are in some
mysterious way animated by the same Spirit who animated and directed Jesus. And
guess what, in Paul's view, are the three most important of these communal habits
of reflecting-Jesus-by-the-Spirit: the same three that Thomas calls the theological
virtues. "And now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; and the greatest of
these is love" (1 Corinthians 13: 13). What am I saying here?

I'm suggesting that (if we take Paul into account) we can be a good bit more
precise about what happens to theologians, and why, and how theologians are
formed by their encounter with God. For what Paul seems to be saying is that when
you see these characteristics (faith, hope, and love) showing up in anybody — even
a theologian — what you have going on is not just a little of the divine way of life
impressing itself within the life of a human being. More than that, you have
someone whose life has begun to partake of Christ's way of being in the world;
what you have is someone whose way of thinking, and acting, and desiring is being
inspired by the same Spirit who led Jesus towards the truth of himself and his
relationship with one he called Abba. It is these three — the Spirit, Jesus, Abba —
who seem to be the continually flowing source of Christian theology, and are the
real teachers of theologians. In fact, we could even say that theology is constantly
in danger of getting carried away — from a respectable discipline managed by
theologians to a mysterious sharing in God's way of life, God's talk (theo-logia),
God's knowing and loving of Godself. This would be theology in the most absolute and perfect sense.

Why do Christians think this?

### Resurrection to Pentecost: Where Christian Theology Begins

Perhaps the simplest way to answer that question is to look at how early followers
of Jesus tried to think about what had happened to them. We're looking for clues
about what it's like to encounter God, and how that encounter might shape the
way you think and feel about things (in analogy to how hanging around a sleepwalker mussel-eater might shape you). The New Testament portrays the disciples
as not only routinely failing to understand Jesus but as frightened and disappointed
to the point of abandoning him at the time of his crucifixion. Something which

they came to describe as Jesus' resurrection began to change this, and began to
form the disciples in a new way.

Let me introduce a brief primary source and commentary here, in order to
reflect very directly on this transformation. Please believe me when I say that the
most important thing I can offer you in this book is likely to be some exposure
fo, these primary sources and some assistance in thinking through them. So don't
skip this bit!

Roughly thirty years after Jesus' death and resurrection, Paul wrote a letter
directed to the Jesus-following community in Rome. It gives an indispensable early
glimpse of how the events surrounding Jesus were coming to inform the life of
the community of his followers throughout the ancient Mediterranean world. My
elucidation of the text is keyed by verse numbers to the original source. Most of
what follows in this chapter will depend upon what we can notice here in thinking
about these passages from the Letter to the Romans.

### The Letter of Paul to the Romans, 6: 3-11

vv3-4 The early followers of Jesus adapted the ritual
washing of baptism to become a sign of initiation into
Jesus' own death and new life. Jesus' death is already
understood as somehow sharable, an event or state of
existence that remains open and available for those
seeking it.

v4 Paul understands Jesus to have been "raised" into a
new state of aliveness, intense presence, and sheer vivacity
by the Father; and he understands this to be an act of
the Father's "glory," the shining forth of divine power in
a manifest way. We might say that this power of the
Father, when it appears within history, takes the form of
the resurrection. In other words, the creative and giving
life of the Father, shining forth within our world, looks
like and indeed is a human being alive again entirely
beyond the power of death. In other texts (e.g., 2 Cor.
5: 17) Paul describes this form of the Father's giving
within our world as an event of new creation.

vv5-6 Sharing in Jesus' death makes possible a sharing in
this raising into a new life by the power of the Father.
The crucial feature to note here is the way Paul envisions
the death and resurrection of Christ as reaching into the
lives of believers. Paul speaks of the "old self" as an
identity we are forced into over time by sin (we might
think of the ways in which we are sometimes forced into
false positions by other people's expectations or peer
pressure or our own poor judgments). This "old self" is
for Paul not really the truth about us but rather a kind
of lie we have been forced into accepting as the truth.
Think, for example, of how the victims of racism are
often forced to conceive of themselves in the demeaning
and derogatory frame of mind used by the dominant
groups. Paul believes that in accepting crucifixion, Jesus
is able to enter these false or old selves, these sinful
constructions of personal life, and let them be "destroyed."
Because of this, believers who "have been united with
him in a death like his," that is, who have surrendered
their old false selves completely, "will certainly be united
with him in a resurrection like his."

v7 In other words, a new identity, a new sense of self
comes to be formed, and in Paul's view this is the
beginning of a person's new life flowing no longer from
the dominating and enslaving patterns of sin but from
the liberating power of God.

v8 Just as Jesus' dying is the power that puts the
self enslaved by sin to death, so also Jesus' rising into
new life is the power that generates a new self for
believers.

vv9-10 Paul conceives of what has happened to Jesus as
an irreversible breakthrough into freedom ("death no
longer has dominion over him"), and a transfer into a
new and infinitely abundant source of life that is not in
any way dominated by sin or death or fear or any of the
things that control people. For Paul this new source of
identity or personal existence is God; Jesus now "lives to
God," meaning that Jesus' whole being now springs
directly from God's infinite life and freedom as compared
with the limited biological life (further weakened by sin)
that normally sources one's existence.

v11 Paul is convinced that this transfer of the source of
one's existence from the dominating slavery of sin to the
liberating freedom of God is now also happening to
believers in Christ. This dying and rising is the impact
that Jesus has on those who live in fidelity and
companionship with him.

In this foundational passage, we have a preliminary sense of how early Christians
understood their life to be shaped and formed, in a continually renewing way.
by the events of Jesus' death and resurrection. Most of what would later come
to be regarded as Christian theology springs from this ongoing transformation
of the community. This is true in two senses: first, because the basic beliefs of
the Christian community (which theology explores, seeking deeper understanding
and coherence) all arise in various ways from this interaction of the community
with Christ; and second, because the very character of the community in search
of theological understanding is also continually shaped by the community's
ongoing encounter with Christ. In fact it is this latter feature that gives rise to
those chief characteristics or gifts (faith, hope, and love) that Paul highlights in
his First Letter to the Corinthians and that Thomas Aquinas discusses as the
'theological virtues."

I can give you a little better picture of this integrity between the community's
beliefs and its character, and how they both spring from the community's encounter
with God, by looking at another passage from the same Letter of Paul to the
Romans.

### Letter to the Romans 8: 9-11, 14-17

vv9-10 To live "in the flesh" for Paul is to live
according to the sources of the old self, namely, a
ceaseless necessity and domination by the powers
holding influence over one's life. To be affiliated with
Christ, by contrast, means to be animated and
enlivened by the same Spirit who animated him.
Living as the followers of Christ comes to mean living
from and with and for Christ, who dwells hiddenly
(or mystically) within the patterns of the community's
life together. In this sense the "body" may be passing,
away, living within the structures of the broken and
sinful world, but the Spirit who enlivens Christ is
now also the Spirit of Christ's community of
followers.

v11 Paul now refers also to "him to who raised Jesus
from the dead." This is a crucial moment, for we have
here (1) the One who by means of this Spirit raises Jesus
from the dead, (2) Jesus who has died and is raised to
new life, and (3) the Spirit who is the agent of this new
life and freedom. In other words we have the Three who
in later Christian reflection would be named the Holy
Trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Paul's point for
the moment is simply that the very same one who raised
Jesus will also pour out this life-giving Spirit within the
community of Jesus. This is doubly remarkable, for it
means not only that in some sense the community lives
as Jesus lives - directly from the Spirit - within it and as
its very head and heart; but it also means that the
community stands in the same relationship to the Father
as Jesus does. Both are raised by the very same Spirit
from death to a new kind of life that reflects the glory of
divine life within the world of time.

v14 Those who follow Jesus, who are "led by the Spirit
of God," even as Jesus was so led in his earthly life, are
also with Jesus "children of God." Note again the
three-fold influence of God upon the community:
Jesus becomes the pattern and form of its life, the Spirit
becomes the guiding inspiration and enlivening power,
and in this way the community together discovers a new
identity as "children of God."

vv15-16 This new relationship with the One who raised
Jesus from the dead is underlined by Paul, precisely in
terms of its formative impact upon the community. For
the community's new identity, the new spirit that
animates it is not "a spirit of slavery" leading "back into
fear," but on the contrary "a spirit of adoption." In
other words, the transformation from an old self driven
by fear and necessity to a new self set free is a
transformation bestowed through relationship with the
very same One whom Jesus called "Abba." This new
relationship seems to be opened up and made available
to the community through Jesus; he cries out "Abba!"
within and on behalf of the community, and so recovers
for it this lost or broken relationship with the Creator
and giver of all life.

v17 The ability of the community to pray in and through
Christ to the Father by the inward working of the Spirit
is, says Paul, the witness to the community's new
relationship to the Father. Sharing in Christ's suffering,
as we saw above, sets believers free from their old selves
controlled by sin and fear; and this opens up for them
Jesus' own trusting relationship with the Father, so that
they may come to be raised into that eternal life and
thus "be glorified with him."

This passage from Romans 8 shows how utterly the ongoing life of the Christian
community is (in Paul's view) a kind of living icon of divine activity in the world.
The Church comes into being as that bit of the world within which God makes
a finite, historical sign of what God is doing all the time and everywhere: forming
the community into a new pattern of life (Christ-like), filling it with the Spirit of
that life of new freedom and trust, and so drawing it into a new identity given
ee its new relationship with God as the outpouring Source or Father of
all life.

Why is all this important for figuring out how theologians do their job? Because
it shows how, exactly, we might notice God's teaching presence as the source
of theology. And this for two reasons. First, because God is the acting agent
who re-creates the new community and brings it to life with a new identity
as God's beloved child; in other words, God is the acting agent continually
evoking and provoking that new identity and _character_, that new way of being
in the world. Second, God is equally the acting agent who inspires and
incites the Church into some _teaching_ about what is happening to it. And as
Christians reflect on what happens to them — from the resurrection of Jesus to
the giving of the Spirit at Pentecost — they notice a trinitarian pattern to their
reflective life

Let me put it this way:

1. Jesus' followers are shaped by
him into a new form of life that shares his
form of life;
so also are their beliefs about what God is doing shaped and
given a form in thought and word and eventually creed. Following Jesus,
as opposed to following someone else, gives a very definite form to life
and thought.

2. Jesus' followers are led by the Spirit into an ever deepening sense of new
identity; this happens as they discover, through the Spirit, the meaning of
Christ's relationship with the Father and their share in that relationship. So
also are they led ever deeper into the truth and meaning of their beliefs about
what God is doing.

3. Jesus' followers, formed in Christ and led by the Spirit, are continually faring
into the presence of the Father who in Christ and through the Spirit raises
them from death to life. So also they are journeying into that state of blessed
intimacy with God when their faith and _beliefs_ will come to an end, being
consummated in the vision of God and perfect beatitude (faith will be super:
seded by sight, and belief by knowing).

What I have been suggesting here is that the character of Christian life and the
beliefs of Christian faith are really two expressions of the same activity, namely,
God's way of re-creating the world. One expression takes the form of practices of
compassion and worship, and the other takes the form of beliefs, teachings, and
a ceaseless quest of faith towards understanding. But both the practices of Christian life and the theory of Christian faith are human expressions of God acting
within the lives and minds of the believing community.
And both expressions have
a markedly three-fold or trinitarian pattern. This means that theology itself, as the
quest of faith for understanding, is really an expression of divine life at work recreating the world in the little laboratory of the Church. We could think of this
trinitarian life of God as the hidden spring of theology:

1. At the still center of every theological formulation, even the most cumbersome
and abstruse, is really the formative and expressive power of Christ the _Word_
provoking the church into reflective teaching

2. At the yearning core of every theologian's search for understanding is the
ceaseless striving of the _Spirit_, pulling the church into an ever deeper sharing
in its new identity in Christ.

3. And at the unseen end of all theological endeavor is the ineffable reality of the
_Father_, calling all things into the perfect fullness of their truth.

For many Christians across the centuries, this has meant that theology is really
a form of prayer or communion with God, in which, ultimately, the thinking
of the theologian about God comes to life as God's presence within the life of
the theologian.

## But Can You Study Theology without Having to Believe?

Does all this mean that everyone who studies theology needs to be a believer
or lead a mystical life? The short answer is simply, "No" (though, if that should
happen, you need not be alarmed). One can study the coherence and interrelationship of Christian ideas and even work out for oneself something of how they might
shed light on many other topics, all without necessarily being a believer oneself.
It would, on the other hand, be a most peculiar study of Christian theology which
was quite unaware of what Christians themselves understood to be its hidden
source of life

By the time of early modernity, however, precisely this mystery of divine life had
become a disputed question rather than a foundational axiom. So whereas earlier
eras of theology had assumed the living priority of divine agency and teaching, this
was very far from being a comfortable starting place for modern theology. This has
led, I fear, to an unfortunate stiltedness and awkwardness when the subject of theology comes up in the academy, because the living spring of theology ~ in encounter
with God — has had to be soberly left out of the discussion.* But we can, I think,
make a useful and legitimate distinction between needing to believe in God in order
to study theology (which I agree is not always necessary), and needing to understand that Christian communities themselves believe
_that theology comes to birth because of their ongoing encounter with God_.
The latter point is quite crucial, because
without it our picture of theology would be gravely distorted.

One needs, in other words, to entertain the idea (which Christians believe) that
Christian theology is an expression of an ongoing transformation of the world in
encounter with God; otherwise one will not be studying Christian theology at all
but only a boringly lifeless taxidermy of it in which nothing unexpected, gloriously
unnecessary, or unbelievable can ever happen or be considered.
And it is, Christians believe, precisely these sorts of wonder and astonishment that characterize
the authentic impact of God on the world, and so on theology.

This is not such an odd assumption with which to engage in academic study.
Many of us have accepted that we did not necessarily have to believe in this or
that concept or theory in order to try to study its features and coherence, to
understand its origins and its meaning for those who interpret the world by means
of it. I do not necessarily have to believe in the truth of Marxism or even in the
existence of quarks and gluons in order to study political philosophy or quantum
physics. But I do have to be sufficiently attuned to what Marxists and quantum
physicists think and say so that I can begin to understand their theories from the
inside. The alternative would be simply to translate everything they say into my
own terms and my own way of thinking about everything. But suppose it is
precisely my own terms and my own way of thinking about everything that is
incapable of conceiving the essential ideas of Marxists or quantum physicists?
Nothing new or astonishing could ever really "get in."

I would be like a person who tries
to understand Spanish by translating everything into English; I would never learn to think in Spanish or perceive reality in
terms of Hispanic culture. I would have a kind of pale, insipid, Anglo version of
what is in reality vibrant and vivacious. Furthermore, I would never have access
to the particularly deft instrument that Hispanic culture could give me
for exploring certain features of life. By analogy, theology (along with
many other disciplines) serves as a particular kind of instrument, an apt
conceptuality, for exploring various dimensions of life.
And, clearly, 
assimilating theology's own mode of reflection to those of, say, cultural
anthropology or philosophy or psychology, will only
short-circuit theology's unique aptness for getting at truth in certain
ways that other disciplines do not.

Perhaps I am needlessly belaboring this point. You may be perfectly happy
exploring theology as an exotic realm of thought without feeling the least need
to believe everything it has to say. If so, bravo for you; you are already going to
find far more of interest than the sort of students who begin by asking theology
not to talk about anything which they don't already know.

Perhaps you are wondering, on the other hand, whether I really mean to
suggest that Christian theology is not in fact actually true or that having Christian
faith makes very little difference to the theological endeavor. Let me try to take
each of these concerns in turn. First, of course I think Christian theology is really
true, indeed (speaking personally) I believe it bears within it a truth more truthful
than anything else I can think of. But as I've been opining all along, this truth is
not something I can just prove to you as an act of logical prestidigitation; it is a
truth more like the truth you discover in getting to know someone with whom
you've begun falling in love. Old marriage rites had the happy pair promising
themselves to each other by saying, "I plight thee my troth," troth being the
word (emerging from Old English) that meant truth precisely as pledged
fidelity and loyalty,

The truth theology bears within itself is this kind of truth that discovers itself
to people in a relationship with someone (God) who is faithful to them. This is a
good example of how reducing Christian theology exclusively to the terms and
concepts and logic of everything we already know is a disaster. Because if I try to
translate theology this way into a series of truths that I can somehow prove to you
according to all the things you already know, then theology's real truth — its truth
as discovered through relationship with God — will become pristinely eclipsed by
the smaller, tidier, and much more manageable kinds of truth that I can demonstrate. But of course, once again, we'd have arrived not at real Christian theology
but a chilly simulacrum with not even a hint of the poignant depths and heartstopping heights of the real thing. So somehow, good academic study of theology
and the truthfulness of Christian theology without
constricting the full scope of those to an academician's ivory tower.

In an interesting lecture entitled "Theology in the university," the
physicist and theologian John Polkinghorne remarks:

> Theology has a natural role in an age of science just because it shares with modern
science this quest for intelligibility. A theological faculty is a necessary presence in a
true university because the search for knowledge is incomplete if it does not include
in its aim gaining knowledge of the Creator as well as gaining knowledge of creatures.
The unity of knowledge is fractured if theology is excluded.*

So the common quest for the truth and intelligibility of existence, which academic
disciplines are privileged to pursue, is not somehow politely put aside whenever
theologians happen to swan into a classroom. Polkinghorne's point is that theology is deft at pursuing an aspect of reality that some other disciplines may not be;
my point is congruent but slightly different, namely that theologians not only
pursue a different aspect of reality, but that their exposure to this reality may, in
important and useful ways, shape their personal capacities for knowing
this dimension of reality. By contrast, as one theologian famously observed, one doesn't
expect necessarily to become personally warmer by studying the laws of thermodynamics; whereas studying the object of theology may, if the theologian is honest
and open, improve the level of communication and interaction with
theology's object of study.

As to the question of faith and theology, I have to make a little confession: my
personal hope is that everyone who studies Christian theology will in fact be given
(should this be desired) the gift of faith. But, in the view of all this that I've been
proposing, the gift of faith is entirely up to God anyway, and so neither here nor
there for academic purposes. You may escape your study of theology perfectly
unscathed by faith. In any case, for the purposes of studying Christian theology, it
is adequate simply to notice and ponder the mysterious role that Christians believe
God plays in shaping their life and thought. So, without insisting in the least that
you, gentle readers, must all become theologians yourselves, let me sketch
very briefly some turning points in a theological life.
This should give us a final, further,
sense of what Christians think happens to those whom God lures into encounter
and how that gives rise to all the various ideas that Christians have.
