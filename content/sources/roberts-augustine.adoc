## An Introduction to St Augustine of Hippo

[NOTE]
Not to be confused with link:/pages/people#_augustine-of-canterbury[Augustine of Canterbury,role=person]!

*Dates:* 354 – 430. ie. All of his life was lived in the post-Constantinian world.
A key source for our knowledge of his life was his _Confessions_, which is a spiritual autobiography
and one of the earliest examples of this genre. It takes the form of a long prayer to God.

*Key works:* link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] was a prolific writer, with comfortably over a hundred surviving works. Of
note are: _Confessions_ (see above), _On the Trinity_, _City of God_, exegetcal works, works against link:/pages/people#_pelagius[Pelagius,role=person] and against the Donatists.
Augustine is a Christian Patristic author of the Western Church, so wrote in Latin.

### Brief Biography

Was born to a Christian mother (Monica) and a pagan father (Patricius) in Thagaste (in present-day
Algeria). As a child, he was admitted as a Christian link:/pages/glossary#_catechumen[catechumen,role=concept], but not baptised. He was educated
in rhetoric – prepared for a career of public/civil responsibility. At university in link:/pages/places#_carthage[Carthage,role=place], he
abandoned his Christianity and took up link:/pages/glossary#_manichaeism[Manichaeism,role=concept].

#### Manichaeism

After the Persian teacher Mani (c. 21h6 – 276) – with roots in Zoroastrianism and
Persian folk religion. It was a radically dualistic religion: evil exists because God’s goodness is
opposed by an entirely separate evil divine entity. The first human beings, Adam and Eve, were
created by this evil spiritual entity. Human beings become a batleground between the forces of
good and evil: we can either follow the good God, or be agents of evil forces – this is played out in
both individual and global terms. As a newer religion than Christianity, link:/pages/glossary#_manichaeism[Manichaeism,role=concept] took on
various features of church organisation from Christianity.
It seems as though in his twentes, link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] was an effective advocate for link:/pages/glossary#_manichaeism[Manichaeism,role=concept], winning
a number of his peers over to the faith. After teaching rhetoric in link:/pages/places#_carthage[Carthage,role=place], he moved from his
native Africa to link:/pages/places#_rome[Rome,role=place] in 383, during which he seems to have become disenchanted by the faith.
His interest moved to Neoplatonism. During this period, he also took a mistress by whom he had
a son.

#### Neoplatonism

A form of link:/pages/glossary#_platonism[Platonism,role=concept] which emerged in the Christian Era (though not expressly
Christian). Key thinkers: Plotinus (c. 205 – c. 270) and link:/pages/people#_porphyry[Porphyry,role=person] (c. 233 – c. 309). Focus on the One
(as an expression of Platonic monotheism) as the Source and End of all being. From the One derive
all other beings through the Nous or Demiurge. The foundation of creation is Spiritual, which is
then expressed in phenomenal terms. In human terms, these correspond first to the human soul
and thence to the physical body. This is close enough to certain expressions of Christianity to make
it ‘not exactly incompatible with’ a lot of patristic thought. It was no surprise that a number of
neo-platonists were drawn to patristic Christianity, including link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person], and that neoplatonism
should exert an interpretative influence on Christian theological philosophy.
After just a year in link:/pages/places#_rome[Rome,role=place], link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] moved to become the professor of rhetoric to the Imperial
Court in link:/pages/places#_milan[Milan,role=place]. Beforehand, however, under the influence of his mother, link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] dismissed his
mistress and their son.

While at link:/pages/places#_milan[Milan,role=place], he became influenced by its bishop, link:/pages/people#_ambrose[Ambrose,role=person] of link:/pages/places#_milan[Milan,role=place] (c. 340 – 397). link:/pages/people#_ambrose[Ambrose,role=person]
was an outstanding intellectual and it was link:/pages/people#_ambrose[Ambrose,role=person]’s intellectual approach, which allowed him to
engage link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] and others in philosophical discourse, together with link:/pages/people#_ambrose[Ambrose,role=person]’s use of allegory
to interpret the Old Testament, which helped to turn link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] back to Christianity. link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person]’s
intellectual defenses were beaten, but he prevaricated until, while in a garden in link:/pages/places#_milan[Milan,role=place], he
overheard children chanting ‘take up and read, take up and read’. He was studying Paul’s epistle to
the Romans, and so he ‘took up and read’ the passage before him, https://www.bible.com/en-GB/bible/2016/rom.13.12-14[Romans 12:13-14]: 

> The night is
far gone, the day is at hand. Let us then lay aside the works of darkness and put on the armour of
light; let us live honourably as in the day, not in revelling or drunkenness, not in debauchery and
licentiousness, not in quarrelling and jealousy. Instead, put on the Lord Jesus Christ and make no
provision for the flesh.

Augustine was baptised by link:/pages/people#_ambrose[Ambrose,role=person] in 387. He returned to Africa, to the family home in Hippo. In
391 he was ordained priest and quickly became famous for his preaching (remember, he was a
teacher of rhetoric). In 395 he was made bishop and remained at Hippo until his death in 430.

### Key themes and Works

#### Writings against the Donatists

See previous lecture on Persecution and the issue of schism in North Africa. The Donatists had split
from the mainstream church over the issue of re-baptism of heretics and schismatics. From the
Donatist point of view, the Holy Spirit only is found inside the true Church. Therefore, the rites and
sacraments of heretical or schismatic ‘churches’ do not have any effect, as a heretical or schismatic
bishop does not possess the gift of the Spirit required for a sacrament of baptism to be effective.
Ironically, the Donatists ‘split’ on this issue from the practice of the wider Church.

The Donatists were particularly successful in Africa, because their practice of re-baptising
schismatics and heretics conformed to the teaching of link:/pages/people#_cyprian[Cyprian,role=person] of Carthage (see earlier lecture).
Cyprian had stated ‘outside the Church there is no salvation’, and had commended re-baptism of
heretics and schismatics. link:/pages/people#_cyprian[Cyprian,role=person] was commended as a martyr by both Donatists and Catholics
alike, so link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] had to step carefully in arguing against a practice link:/pages/people#_cyprian[Cyprian,role=person] himself had
commended. Nevertheless, whatever link:/pages/people#_cyprian[Cyprian,role=person] may have said, the wider Church outside Africa
tended not to re-baptise those who had been baptised by schismatical groups and had a variable
policy in regard to heretical baptism. link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person], as bishop of the Catholic Church in Africa, needed
to defend his position theologically whilst honouring the memory of link:/pages/people#_cyprian[Cyprian,role=person].

Augustine argued that sacraments (like baptism and the eucharist) had two parts: an inward
(spiritual) part and an outward (visible) part – ie. the rite itself. It was possible to have the outward
part, without possessing the inward benefits. In the case of a schismatic baptism, those baptised
did genuinely get ‘outwardly’ baptised, but were not in possession of baptism’s spiritual benefits
(forgiveness of sins, new birth) because of the sin of schism in which the rite took part. #For
Augustine, the biggest sin of schismatics was the failure to love, in that they stood apart from the
rest of the Church by separating themselves of from them. Since love is the ‘first commandment’
this was a serious sin, and the root problem in schismatic groups.#

The second part of link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person]’s argument was that sacraments work by virtue of Jesus’
righteousness, not by the righteousness of the person administering the sacrament. But
schismatics, by separating themselves from their brothers and sisters, also separated themselves
from Christ himself. It was this which nullified the inward power of their sacraments, not merely
that they were administered by ‘the wrong franchise’. The conclusion of link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person]’s argument was that the answer to the problem was for the candidate
to re-unite themselves to Christ by returning into fellowship with the rest of the Church. This re-
established the love connection, and the inward benefits – which always relied on Christ’s
righteousness – made their baptism valid and effective inwardly as well as outwardly. link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person]
had succeeded in providing a theological justification for the widespread practice of Catholic
Christianity! #However, this emphasis on love did not stop him later using the law to persecute
Donatists in Africa, as bishop of the Empire-sponsored (Catholic) faith!#

#### Augustine versus Pelagius

Pelagius was a Celtic priest, who was shocked by hearing a reading of link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person]’s Confessions.
Augustine was vehement in ascribing to grace (and grace alone) the reason for conversion. For
Pelagius, this nullified any human responsibility for salvation, good works and the need to obey
God. It is arguable that link:/pages/people#_pelagius[Pelagius,role=person]’ position was closer to the Church’s liturgy than link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person]’s more
abstract theology of grace. As the debate between the two deepened, various polarities emerged:

- link:/pages/people#_pelagius[Pelagius,role=person] believed that all humans are born innocent and have exercise of free will to choose
God’s will;
- link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] believed that all humans are born sinful and their will is damaged by sin so they
cannot choose God’s will and be saved;
- link:/pages/people#_pelagius[Pelagius,role=person] believed the journey to salvation involved an active doing of good works as part of
the process towards becoming a Christian and resulting salvation (through baptism);
- link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] believed the journey to salvation depended utterly on grace alone, and was
totally a gift from God, without reference to any goodness within the convert;
- link:/pages/people#_pelagius[Pelagius,role=person] #believed that human beings had an active part to play over whether they received
God’s grace or not – ie. they could choose whether to be saved or not;#
- link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] #believed that God had predestined a subset of humanity to be saved and to
these, and these alone, he gave grace which led inevitably to their salvation through
conversion and baptism; the rest of humanity had been elected by God not to be saved but
to die as sinners#

Along with the rest of the Church of the time, both link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] and link:/pages/people#_pelagius[Pelagius,role=person] regarded baptism as
the principal channel to receiving Christ and salvation. However, since link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] taught that even
a new-born infant was a sinner in need of redemption, his teaching accelerated the take-up of
infant baptism with a renewed sense of urgency and necessity, since unbaptised infants had no
hope of salvation.

Why did link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] believe even new-born infants were sinners in need of redemption, when they
had not committed actual sin of their own? Is answer is that at conception all human beings
inherit the sin of Adam – original sin – from their parents and that this is passed on because no act
of procreative sex (by the parents) is entirely free of the sin of lust. #All humanity is, for link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person],
naturally a lump of sin – some scholars argue that this reflects a return to his earlier attitudes
when he was a Manichaean.#

#### _City of God_

This book was triggered by the sack of link:/pages/places#_rome[Rome,role=place] by invading Visigoths. Sought to explain why the
Christian Empire was less stable to collapse than the old Pagan empire had been. link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person], in the
book lays out an interpretation of all of history as a battle between the ‘City of God’ and the ‘City of Man’. He distinguishes between these two ciites in present history as well as past: therefore,
just because the Empire is now Christian does not imply that it is equal to the City of God. Sin can
still cause the Empire to crumble, but the City of God will never crumble – it will triumph. This
helps avoid a simplistic assumption that because an empire (or country) is ruled by a Christian, that
that country will act any better or fare any better than a pagan empire or country. History, for
Augustine, is a spiritual struggle, where the politics don’t necessarily correspond to the spiritual
world.

By implication, the present Church as _we can perceive it_ (ie. the Visible Church) is not the City of
God either, as it may contain within itself sinners and hypocrites. Only in the final, heavenly City, at
the end of history will the saved and purified Church be equal to the City of God. This was
important reassurance for Christians of the Western (Latin) Church in the midst of the crumbling
Western Empire. The Eastern Empire did not fully collapse until the fall of Constantinople in 1453.
Thus link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person]’s work differentiated between the Visible and the Invisible Church, the Church
Militant (on earth, still struggling) and the Church Triumphant (in heaven, victorious at the end of time).

#### The Trinity

We have seen in the previous session how the Councils struggled with terminology (Greek) in
defining the nature of the Christian God as Trinity. link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person]’s writing on the Trinity (_De Trinitate_)
some time after the Council of Constantinople (381) marks a move away from the politics of the
councils, with their proofs from salvation history, towards a more philosophical approach.
Augustine’s _De Trinitate_ provides a fundamental way of understanding how God can be One and
yet Three. He uses the Biblical assertion that God is love to describe, by way of analogy, how the
different persons of the godhead can be one, yet relate in that oneness of love. But link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person], in
providing a justification for Trinitarian language, goes on to relate the doctrine to the need for
reconciliation to God (and hence for the need for salvation) and also to provide a basis for
understanding the nature of our humanity and hence to provide an interpretative framework for
spiritual growth.

The work demonstrates the sophistication and power of link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] as a philosopher, and provided
that basis for philosophical theology in Western thought for centuries to come.
