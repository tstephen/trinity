## The Monastic Rescue of the Church

### Benedict's Rule (530)

St. Benedict wrote his Rule in the first part of the sixth century in order to guide monks
to holiness and correct the monastic abuses of his day. Five centuries later, Bernard of
Clairvaux (1090-1153) was called to reform the Benedictine monasteries that had lapsed
into worldliness. Contemporary issues propelled Bernard, a mystic passionately devoted to
God, into playing a major role in politics and ecclesiastical renewal. A renowned preacher
and writer, Bernard was so popular that many of the best medieval Latin hymns were
ascribed to him, even though actual authorship is uncertain.

One of these hymns, “O Sacred Head, Now Wounded,” exemplifies some of the finest
aspects of continuity in the tradition of Christian devotion. The original Latin version dates
from the twelfth century. The Lutheran hymnist Paul Gerhardt translated it into German in
the seventeenth century, and in the next century Johann Sebastian Bach arranged it for
his Passion Chorale. Then in the nineteenth century the Presbyterian scholar and pastor
James W, Alexander translated it into English. The lyrics present a stirring contemplation
of God's love displayed on the cross and the loving response that Christ's suffering calls
forth, themes that were always prominent when monasticism was at its best.

----
O sacred Head, now wounded,

With grief and shame weighed down;
Now scornfully surrounded

With thorns Thine only crown:

How pale Thou art with anguish,

[page 77]

With sore abuse and scorn!
How does that visage languish
Which once was bright as morn!

What Thou, my Lord, has suffered
Was all for sinners’ gain;

Mine, mine was the transgression,
But Thine the deadly pain.

Lo, here | fall, my Savior!

‘Tis | deserve Thy place;

Look on me with Thy favor,
Vouchsafe to me Thy grace.

What language shall | borrow
To thank Thee, dearest Friend,
For this Thy dying sorrow,
Thy pity without end?

O make me Thine forever;
And should | fainting be,
Lord, let me never, never
Outlive my love to Thee.!

The rise of monasticism was, after Christ’s commission to his disciples,

the most important—and in many ways the most beneficial—institutional event in the history of Christianity. For over a millennium, in the
centuries between the reign of Constantine and the Protestant Reformation,
almost everything in the church that approached the highest, noblest, and truest ideals of the gospel was done either by those who had chosen the monastic
way or by those who had been inspired in their Christian life by the monks.
If we remember that “the monastic way” included all who “separated” from
the world and followed a “rule” of discipline—women as well as men—we
can say much the same for the more recent centuries of the church’s history.
The monastic contribution to “whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever
is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable” (Phil.
4:8) may have shrunk in visibility over the past few centuries, but it still remains high. With reference to much more recent history, it is only necessary to

mention Mother Teresa of Calcutta, founder of the Order of the Missionaries
of Charity, to make the point.

Even a Protestant who thinks monasticism is flawed in ways that will be
suggested at the end of this chapter can make such claims on its behalf with a
cleat conscience. Protestantism itself, we may well remember, began with the
monastic experiences of Martin Luther. Once Luther, John Calvin, Thomas
Cranmer, Menno Simons, and other leaders of the Reformation concluded
it was necessary to break from the Roman Catholic Church, they drew support for their theology first from Scripture, but then immediately from the
writings of monks. Luther and Calvin, especially, returned repeatedly to the
work of Augustine (354-430), who had been not only a learned theologian,
busy bishop, and energetic polemicist but also the founder of a monastic
order, In fact, Luther began his biblical study and theological reflections as
an _Augustinian_ monk.

The breadth and depth of monastic influence in the church can be sketched
quickly by observing the lineage of attitudes and actions that have been approved by almost all Christians everywhere. If we read the Scripture in our
native languages, we benefit from a tradition of biblical translation inspired
by the monk Jerome (circa 342-420). If we sing together the praises of Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit, we follow where the hymn-writing monks Gregory
(circa 540-604) and Bernard of Clairvaux led the way. If we pursue theology,
we inevitably find ourselves indebted to the monks Augustine and Thomas
Aquinas (circa 1225-74). If we pray for the success of Christian missions, we
ask for blessing upon enterprises pioneered by the monks Patrick (circa 390-
circa 460), Boniface (680-754), Cyril (826-69) and his brother Methodius (circa
815-85), and Raymond Lull (circa 1233-circa 1315). If we are interested in the
past record of Christianity in English-speaking areas of the world, we cultivate
a historical concern begun by a monk, the Venerable Bede (circa 673-735). If
we glory in the goodness that God imparted to the created world, we follow
where the friar Francis of Assisi (1181/82-1226) blazed the trail. Monasticism
was never a perfect answer to the question of how to live the Christian life.
Its impact, nonetheless, cannot be underestimated. And that impact has been
largely for the good.

It is difficult to specify a single turning point at which monasticism began
to influence the church decisively.
footnote:[For the account that follows, I draw especially on W. H. C. Frend, The Rise of Christianity (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1984); F. F Bruce, The Spreading Flame: The Rise and Progress of Christianity from Its First Beginnings to the Conversion of the English (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1958); and Christopher Dawson, The Foundation of Christendom (New York: Sheed & Ward, 1967), For a contemporary appreciation of the monastic tradition from an evangelical Protestant perspective, see Dennis L. Okholm, Monk Habits for Everyday People: Benedictine Spirituality for Protestants (Grand Rapids: Brazos, 2007).]
 
For the most important turning point in the development of monasticism, there are in fact a number of prime candidates.
It could be the first recorded monk, Antony, who left his family’s farm in Egypt
sometime around 270 to go out by himself to the edge of the desert in order
to find God. It might be his fellow Egyptian Pachomius, who around 320 established the first cenobitic (or communal) monastery under the guidance of a
“rule” (or set of regulations) for a life of prayer. It could be Basil of Caesarea,
one of the Cappadocian fathers, who did so much to define the Holy Spirit as
a full member of the Trinity. About 370 Basil wrote a rule for the monasteries
under his care in Cappadocia (modern eastern-central Turkey) that serves to this
day as the basic guide for monastic life in the Orthodox Church. Athanasius,
the great fourth-century defender of Christ’s divinity, could be singled out as
a key figure in the rise of monasticism, since his biography of Antony both
identified monasticism solidly with doctrinal orthodoxy and greatly expanded
knowledge of monastic ways in both East and West. It could also be Martin of
Tours, who in 360 founded the first monastery in what is now France, and so
began the momentous career of monasticism as the primary bearer of Christianity into northern Europe. Or it could be John Cassian, who, living in the
south of France early in the fifth century, wrote an influential book that distilled
much of the monastic wisdom of the East for dissemination in the West.

But as important as all these and many other early influences were for
the emergence of monasticism, it is almost certainly Benedict of Nursia (in
Italy) who gave the most decisive, and most beneficial, shape to monasticism.
It is to Benedict and his famous Rule that the Christian church owes a series
of invaluable gifts—for regulating a zealous spirit that had often bordered
on fanaticism; for curbing a practice of asceticism that easily slid over into
Gnosticism, Docetism, or worse;
footnote:[Gnosticism and Docetism are related heresies that regard the physical world as inferior to the purely spiritual. The word “docetism” comes from the Greek dokeo, “seem”; Docetists believed that Jesus was a spiritual being who only seemed to be human. This devaluing of the human body sometimes led to ascetic extremes, which Benedict sought to curb. For example, hearing that a certain hermit had chained himself in his cave, the saint sent him this message: “If you are indeed a servant of God, do not chain yourself with chains of iron. But rather, let Christ be the chain that binds you.” Quoted in Esther de Waal, Seeking God: The Way of St. Benedict (Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 1984), 22-23.]
for preserving the centrality of Scripture
in a movement that made much of inner spiritual illumination; for recalling
prayer to the heart of the Christian life; for linking exalted religious experience
with the basic realities of work, study, eating, and sleeping; and, not least, for
providing an ideal of monastic life in which reformers have found inspiration
and encouragement for fifteen hundred years.

The magnitude of Benedict’s
significance in the history of Christianity is not, however, matched by
knowledge of his life. About forty

oe years after his death (and the precise
5 ae year of death is not even known),
Pope Gregory I wrote a series of
dialogues on noteworthy believers of previous eras; his account
of Benedict contains almost all the
solid biographical information we
have about him.

Benedict (circa 480—circa 550) was
educated at Rome, where he found
One of the many memorials of Benedict and his the prevailing standards so degenerate that he abandoned the city for a
life of solitary religious devotion at
Subiaco. Because of his growing reputation for spiritual insight, a number
of others gathered around him. Eventually Benedict is said to have founded
twelve separate monasteries with twelve monks each, but it is also reported
that in these early years he was the object of jealous attacks by some who
had originally come out to seek the life of prayer with him. Sometime around
525 Benedict moved south of Rome to Monte Cassino,
footnote:[Monte Cassino, the “cradle of the Benedictine Order,” has been destroyed and rebuilt several times, the most recent destruction coming in World War II when Allied commanders bombed the monastery in the mistaken belief that it was held by the Germans.]
where he established
a monastery that exists to this day. It was probably after arriving at Monte
Cassino and as part of an effort to reform the general practice of monast
cism that Benedict composed his regula. This Rule soon won nearly universal approval as providing the shape for monasticism in the West. Its only
serious rival was the Celtic monasticism inspired by St. Patrick in the fifth
century and spread by St. Columba (circa 521-97) from a famous monastery
on the Isle of Iona off the coast of Scotland. Benedict’s Rule was read also
with appreciation in the East; it became the norm for tens of thousands of
new monastic communities in Europe, and it served as an inspiration for
the slightly altered ideals that created the Mendicant Orders (or “friars”)
in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Never in the recorded history of
Christianity has a person whose own life remains so obscure done a deed
with greater public consequences.


In order to gain a better sense of how important Benedict's Rule was in
shaping the course of monasticism, and also how pivotal monasticism became
in shaping the course of Christianity, it is necessary to probe a little more
deeply into the motives that led to the rise of monasticism as an institution.
‘That exercise will, in turn, make it possible to see why Benedict and his Rule
were so critical to the spread of monasticism throughout the Middle Ages,
and it also will put us in a position to make an evaluation of the gifts (and
problems) that monasticism bequeathed to the church.

### Motives and Circumstances

Conditions in the fourth and fifth centuries provided powerful motivations
for the spread of monasticism. The persecutions under Decius in the mid-
third century and under Diocletian in the early fourth century took place at
the same time that economic difficulties disoriented traditional patterns of
life throughout many parts of the Roman Empire, especially Egypt. The first
monks, like Antony, who left Egyptian cities for the desert, were thus departing from a world where both spiritual and secular conditions lay in disarray.

Much more important for the spread of monasticism, however, was reaction
to the church’s greatest success. With the rise of the Constantinian church—
state establishment, the life of a Christian “professional” offered considerable
potential for worldly preferment. Although intraecclesiastical strife and strenuous differences of opinions with the emperors could make life precarious for bishops and priests, service in the church after Constantine could also offer
stability, access to power, and a reasonable opportunity for wealth. Monasticism was a response, often inarticulate, that reflected spiritual concern about the church’s success. The self-denial and privations of the monks, although
a result now of self-imposed decisions, were a way of recovering the ideals of
martyrdom. To be sure, the monastic effort to seek out an existence of living
martyrdom threatened to create a two-tiered picture of Christianity. Soon
monks, or the “athletes of God,” seemed to be pursuing the true Christian
faith, while ordinary people in ordinary human circumstances were consigned
to a subordinate spiritual status. Yet even with the dangers posed by such a
division (monks thinking of their spirituality more highly than they ought,
ordinary people thinking too little of the spirituality within their daily life),
the monastic response to the Constantinian situation proved effective. In order
to save critical Christian ideals such as self-sacrifice and humility, as well as
to promote Christian disciplines like prayer and study of the Scriptures, the
monks became the conscience of Christendom.

[page 83]

Ironically, however, the monastic willingness to forsake all to follow only
Christ eventually bequeathed its own form of worldly reward. Monks gave
up the prospect of economic gain and the practices of married life, but they
received in return considerable respect and at least some anchorage in turbulent
times. It is probably not a coincidence that Antony began monastic practice
shortly after the disruptive reign of Decius, or that Benedict’s Rule became so
popular immediately after the final collapse of the Roman Empire in the West
(the last Roman emperor was expelled from Italy in 476, less than a decade
before Benedict’s birth). Monasticism did not hold out prospects of wealth or
sensual enjoyment, but it did offer the western Mediterranean world a hope
of stable Christian community at times of severe social disorder.

If the growth of monasticism depended upon general conditions in the
Roman-Christian world, it also drew on several important strands of spiritual,
theological, and biblical tradition. What could be called the inner motivations
of monasticism already enjoyed a vigorous heritage by the fourth and fifth
centuries.

The most important, and most enduring, of these inner motives was commitment to the Scriptures. Antony, the first of the monks, had gone into the
desert after hearing Matthew 19:21 read during a Sunday service (“If you
want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will
have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me”). Antony had only recently
received a substantial inheritance of land from his parents. In these circumstances, the text so captured his attention that he went out and did exactly
as the Gospel enjoined.

In addition, the monks returned repeatedly to injunctions and models of
living especially drawn from the New Testament. Paul’s discussion of 
marriage from 1 Corinthians 7, for example, exerted a direct impact (“Now to
the unmarried and the widows I say: It is good for them to stay unmarried,
as do”). John the Baptist’s life in the desert as an unmarried seeker for God
loomed just as large, but not as large as the example of Jesus, who forsook
family and wealth to do his Father’s bidding and who sometimes went into
the wilderness to pray. The ideal was to seek God single-mindedly—to pray
without ceasing (1 Thess. 5:17). Monks believed this effort would be aided by
removing worldly distractions. The life of prayer, in turn, would transform
them into a charitable and hospitable people.

Immersion in Scripture remained a permanent characteristic. Even if there
came periods in monastic history when the use of Scripture grew perfunctory,
preoccupation with the Bible was constant. Most early records of cenobitic
monasticism in Egypt contain the stipulation that would-be novices memorize
twenty psalms, two epistles, or a biblical passage of comparable length as a requirement to enter the monastery.
[page 84]
 Similarly, Benedict’s Rule is thickly studded
with biblical quotations, and injunctions to constant reading (in Scripture and
other Christian literature) make up a major part of his concern. Even in periods
of modern church history when Protestants and Catholics had nothing good
to say about each other, it is striking that Protestants continued to remember
that they owed a great debt to the monastic houses that had preserved, copied,
and studied the Scriptures throughout the Middle Ages. Monasticism, in brief,
was built upon a foundation of Scripture.

‘At the same time, the ascetic drift of early Christian spirituality strongly
influenced the way that Scripture was applied in the formation of monasticism.
In the West, where practical solutions were more important than theological
speculation, the standard view of reconciliation with God exerted considerable influence on how the Bible was read. That view was being systematized by
Tertullian at the end of the second century in a way that favored what would
later emerge as monastic spirituality. Tertullian held that the one who sought
reconciliation needed to pass through distinct stages: penitence (or active sorrow
for sin), mortification (deadening of the flesh through ascetic practices), merit
(securing of the right to be rewarded by God), and satisfaction (reparation by
alms, fasting, or other good works for the damage done to God’s holiness). These
stages were all dependent upon God’s grace displayed by Christ on the cross, but
they had the effect of making conscientious human effort quite important. In
terms growing from Tertullian’s formulations, monasticism represented serious,
systematic, and full-time attention to the divine requirements for reconciliation.

Eastern asceticism had other sources. During the third century, Clement
and Origen had put Neoplatonic forms of thought to use in the church. Their
foundational Christian convictions made such Greek thought relatively safe
for use by believers, but the Neoplatonic tendency to treat the created realm
as only a shadow of ultimate realities—which were located beyond the material realm—nonetheless remained to influence Christianity. Such teachings
promoted a spirituality that tended to devalue ordinary physical existence
and stress the purely spiritual.

This Neoplatonic influence was strongest in the East, but it occurred in the
‘West as well. Augustine’s pathbreaking autobiography, the Confessions (written 397-401), described in detail his passage through various philosophical
and religious stages on the journey to Christian faith. Among those stages
were a period of fascination with Platonism (with its hierarchy of forms) and
another with Manichaeanism (with its conception of a universe sharply divided
between forces of good and evil). Augustine’s conversion to Christianity meant
his liberation from the toils of these religious systems, but it did not mean
that their influence was entirely effaced. One of his characteristic metaphors

[page 85]

for serious Christian living remained a journey upward out of the materiality
of day-to-day life into realms of pure spirituality. Thus, in the Confessions,
Augustine’s Christian evaluation of his own struggle with sin was couched in
language drawn from Neoplatonic thought: for example, “But I did not stay
in the enjoyment of my God; I was swept away to you by your own beauty,
and then I was torn away from you by my own weight and fell back groaning
toward these lower things. Carnal habit was this weight.”
footnote:[The Confessions of St. Augustine, trans. Rex Warner (New York: New American Library, 1963), 153.]

These varied influences in the world of early Christianity—whether Neo-
platonic, Platonic, or Manichacan—all moved in the same direction. They
tended to view the ideal Christian life as passing from the ordinary, the 
material, and the terrestrial into the extraordinary, the spiritual, and the celestial.
When combined with the Scriptures’ repeated injunctions to, for example, “set
your hearts on things above” (Col. 3:1) or to avoid worry “about your body,
what you will wear” (Matt. 6:25 and Luke 12:22), these influences exerted a
powerful motive for monasticism. By definition, the monastic way was designed
precisely to allow creatures of the earth to rise toward a purer spirituality.

The particular monastic renunciation of sexual practice flowed from this
more general tendency. Paul’s injunction to remain unmarried, if possible,
was the spark, but much of the shape for the monastic ideal of chastity was
provided by the dualism—especially the dualism between spirit and matter—so prevalent in Greek thought. The physical world, as perceived by many
early theologians, was the realm in which Satan exerted his greatest influence.
Regulating that world as carefully as possible was a way of forsaking the ruler
of this present darkness for the Lord of Light.

This perception of the world as an active, ever-tumultuous scene of spiritual combat also fueled the monastic surge. Especially in the Egypt of early
monasticism, but also throughout most of the early church, believers were
deeply fascinated by demons, angels, and conflict between spiritual forces in
high places. The way that monasticism deployed this largely biblical picture
of the world was that monks, as full-time ascetics, were widely considered to
be the only ones spiritually fit enough to contribute directly in that struggle.
Early accounts of Antony featured his wrestling with demons and the ungodly
passions they incited. Such emphases remained a potent spur to monasticism
throughout its earliest centuries.

The story of Simeon Stylites (circa 390-459) shows clearly how different the
thought processes of early Christians could be from our own. Simeon, who lived
out his life in the general vicinity of Antioch in Syria, became an anchorite (or
solitary monk) in early adulthood. At some later stage he departed into a desert
region where he began building a pillar as his place of abode. For the last decades
of his life, he remained perpetually on this pillar, which he continued to construct
until it reached a great height. Simeon obviously felt that this act of self-isolation
allowed him to concentrate solely on spiritual realities and to prepare him for taking an active part in the supernatural warfare that enveloped the earth. Although
moderns might consider Simeon more of an eccentric than a saint, it is important
to realize why a relatively full account of Simeon has come down in history. His
life was well recorded for the simple fact that Simeon’s contemporaries found
him an immensely attractive figure. A steady stream of visitors presented itself
to the pillar. Simeon’s direct influence led to conversions and to breakthroughs
where warring church factions were reconciled. It is even reported that Simeon’s
commendation of the Chalcedon Definition greatly assisted its acceptance in his
region. Only when we realize how the account of a sunburned ascetic passing
messages (and life’s meager necessities) up-and-down in a bucket from a lofty
pillar could have struck such a responsive chord will we begin to understand why
monasticism proved so satisfying to so many earnest Christians and exerted such
a powerful force throughout the whole Christian world.

One of the difficulties in presenting early monasticism is that the record is so
varied. For every extreme ascetic like Simeon, many revered figures existed who
were known for gentleness, moderation, wisdom, and extraordinary hospitality
displayed toward the outcast and fallen. A danger in studying monasticism is
that this equally significant strain can be overshadowed by the more bizarre, even
if many desert fathers discouraged extreme practices. In general, what made
the early monks so compelling was their reputation as great people of prayer.

Monasticism grew, therefore, not only because it was a form of Christian
organization and a collection of Christian ideals attractive during the time
of transition to the public establishment of the church. Even more important
for the growth of monasticism was its connection to some of the most basic
theological tendencies and spiritual instincts of early Christian history. That
combination of general conditions and inner spiritual propulsion, especially
when it produced a remarkable array of spiritual and practical services, helps
explain how monasticism emerged as such a potent force and why it remained
so central for such a long stretch of the church’s history.

### Benedict and His Rule

The Rule of Benedict played a decisive role in the history of monasticism, and
therefore in the history of Christianity, because it combined the zeal of earlier

[page 87]

monastic pioneers with a carefully balanced concern for stability. Benedict’s
Rule is famous for codifying vows of obedience, stability, and conversatio
morum (continual conversion) that led on to the more general vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. But it was equally noteworthy for its farsighted
concern for what it would take to keep individual monks and entire monastic
communities on an even keel. The Rule, though a relatively long document
of some eighty large-print pages in Timothy Fry’s English edition, was also
intentionally flexible. It suggested how its own guidelines could be adapted to
local conditions defined by different stages of the ecclesiastical year, different
climates, different quantities of available food and drink depending on the
monks’ health, age, and even degree of spiritual maturity.

Benedict’s Rule was not a manual for slackers. It enshrined, for example,
the wisdom of the first Christian centuries about higher spirituality in sternly
forbidding personal possessions: “Above all, this evil practice [of private ownership] must be uprooted and removed from the monastery. We mean that without
an order from the abbot [the leader], no one may presume to give, receive or
retain anything as his own, nothing at all.”
footnote:[The Rule of St. Benedict in English, ed. Timothy Fry, OSB (Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 1981), 56. Subsequent page references in the text are to this edition.]
The Rule also made it clear that
even younger members were to join the search for perfection. It made provisions for older monks to sleep in the same rooms with the younger so that,
when the bell was rung for prayers at midnight, all might “rise without delay
when the signal is given; each will hasten to arrive at the Work of God before
the others, yet with all dignity and decorum” (49). The reason for mixing old
and young together was so that “on arising for the Work of God,” they might
“quietly encourage each other, for the sleepy like to make excuses” (49).

If the Rule was stern, however, it was stern for clear theological reasons.
Many of the Rule’s most important provisions spelled out the theological
justifications for important monastic practices, for example, the critical mandate to work: “Idleness is enemy of the soul. Therefore, the brothers should
have specified periods for manual labor as well as for prayerful reading” (69).
Benedict probably had more the “manual labor” in mind as a standard for
work than the “prayerful reading,” but his grouping of physical and mental
labor together opened the way to the monks’ great contribution to learning
that would be sustained almost from the first.

The Rule is marked throughout by a concentration on the spiritual realities
that monasteries existed to embody. At the foundation was commitment to the
practice of prayer: “Whenever we want to ask some favor of a powerful man,
we do it humbly and respectfully, for fear of presumption. How much more


important, then, to lay our petitions before the Lord God of all things with the
utmost humility and sincere devotion. We must know that God regards our purity
of heart and tears of compunction, not our many words. Prayer should therefore
be short and pure” (48). The practice of prayer, moreover, was to mold a life of
prayerfulness: “The life of a monk ought to beacontinuous Lent... . This we can
do ina fitting manner by refusing to indulge evil habits and by devoting ourselves
to prayer with tears, to reading, to compunction of heart and self-denial” (71).

A life of prayer, however, was not to be artificially divorced from a life of
service. It is doubtful that Benedict could have foreseen the myriad activities
of practical godliness that later monks who followed his Rule pursued, but
aspects of the Rule provided a basis for those later developments. Injunctions,
for example, to care for strangers and for the sick contained the seeds for
significant future charitable work: “All guests . . . are to be welcomed as Christ,
for he himself will say: ‘I was a stranger and you welcomed me’ [Matt. 25:35]”
(73); and “Care of the sick must rank above and before all else, so that they
may truly be served as Christ, for he said: ‘I was sick and you visited me’ [Matt.
25:36]” (59). From such beginnings would grow vast monastic enterprises
attending to the body as well as to the soul.

The concluding words of the Rule speak for its entire character; they are
calm, judicious, and God-centered, yet also filled with hope for progress, by
the grace of God, in the disciplined Christian life: “Are you hastening toward
your heavenly home? Then with Christ’s help, keep this little rule that we
have written for beginners. After that, you can set out for the loftier summits
of the teaching and virtues we mentioned above, and under God’s protection
you will reach them” (95-96).

The ordinary daily round shaped by Benedict’s rule varied by place, era,
personality of the abbot, and many other factors. Especially the relationship
of a monastery’s abbot to the neighboring bishop (or bishops) became a major
issue through much of the Middle Ages. When some monastic foundations
grew large, and even prosperous, the reality of the abbot’s power, who might
preside over a whole chain of daughter monasteries, was often much greater
than thar of the local bishops. When such abbots fulfilled the ideals set out for
their position in Benedict’s Rule, it could be a boon to the church. But when
they fell prey to avarice or power-mongering, such abbots could be a disaster
for general church affairs and a snare for the ordinary monks.

For their part, the ordinary monks were usually not directly affected by
the high politics involving abbots, bishops, and secular rulers. As a typical
example, the Benedictine monastery of Durham in England was founded in 1083 through the cooperation of the archbishop of Canterbury, the king of
England, the pope, and local church officials. A few centuries later, the daily
round in summer of the monks at the Durham monastery looked like this: Up
at six for prayers in the church, then a light breakfast, then work or reading.
After nine o’clock a series of Masses and meetings were held in the monastic
church. The afternoon saw an alternation of work and prayer, with supper
at 6:00 p.m., followed by prayers and then an early bedtime. At midnight the
monks arose for prayer again.
footnote:[See Anne Boyd, The Monks of Durham (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1975), 16-18]
And so it went— _orare et laborare_ —praying
and working, praying and working, throughout the passing of the seasons
and the rolling of the years.


Well before the Benedictine
monastery was established in
Durham, monastic establishments

England (Fourteenth Century) for women had become common-place throughout Europe. Early praise for virginity played a part
in the growth of female monastic
orders. Cyprian in the third century
had called virgins the flower of the
church; especially after the Virgin
Mary became more prominent in the church’s liturgy and theology.

 Throughout the Middle Ages, the monastic life provided one of the
 few venues where women were allowed (and sometimes even encouraged) to express publicly their
 grasp of the Christian faith. Thus Hildegard of Bingen (1098-1179),
ae founder and first abbess of the
 Benedictine community at Ruperts-

berg on the Rhine, was renowned
not only for her mystical visions
but also for a remarkable set of
writings on scientific, theological,
and musical subjects as well as for
discerning correspondence with
kings, bishops, and leaders of other
monastic institutions. The histo-
tian Caroline Walker Bynum has

centuries won unusual hearing for their writings, dialogues, and prayers.
footnote:[Caroline Walker Bynum, Holy Feast and Holy Fast: The Religious Significance of Food: to Medieval Women (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1987).]
This recognition came about through widespread respect for their rigors in
fasting and their experience of mystical union with Christ in the Eucharist.
That respect was the vehicle for women like Hadewijch (writings from 1220-
40), the first great poet in Flemish, and Catherine of Siena (circa 1347-80)
whose ministry included ecclesiastical and papal reform, to have the sort of
impact in their day that the life of self-denial had won for Simeon Stylites in
his day.

The pattern established by Benedict’s Rule came to be applied widely and
with great effect. For men and women, in all parts of Europe and beyond.
through times of monastic flourishing and periods of monastic decay, it 
remained a beacon pointing back to the disciplined stability of a spiritual ideal
and forward toward growth into eternal blessedness.

### A Brief Outline of Important Monastic Developments in the Middle Ages

A sketch is not the best way to treat the complex history of monasticism
during the European Middle Ages, but it may be enough to suggest the great
importance of monasticism as sustaining and expanding the church in that era.

In the first instance, the missionary expansion of Christianity was unthink-
able apart from the activity of monks. A fine survey of world missions by
Stephen Neill, who himself served as a missionary in India, divided the missionary history of the Middle Ages into a five-hundred-year period (500-1000)
in which the main task was to draw the barbarians into the Christian orbit
and a succeeding five hundred years (1000-1500) in which the great task was
to turn nominally Christian Europeans into genuine believers.
footnote:[Stephen Neill, A History of Christian Missions (New York: Penguin, 1964), 61-139.]
The key element in both of these gigantic efforts was monasticism.

In Neill’s first phase, monks of several kinds did the pioneering work that
was necessary to spread news of Christianity beyond the settled boundaries
of the old Roman Empire northward, westward, and eastward into barbarian Europe. Celtic missionaries were pioneers, with Patrick’s preaching in
Ireland during the fifth century as the vanguard. Later missionaries from
England and Scotland combined Celtic fortitude with Benedictine order in
using monastic foundations as a way of anchoring missionary outreach. Thus.
Boniface (680-754), who is often called the apostle of Germany, lived until age
forty as a monk in England but then traveled widely in what is now modern
France, Germany, and the Low Countries in a series of pathbreaking mission
tours. One of the most enduring of his many legacies to northern European
Christianity was the founding of a Benedictine monastery at Fulda (northeast
of Frankfurt, Germany), which long remained a center for further missionary
outreach. Of the monk Boniface, the modern historian Christopher Dawson
once wrote that he “had a deeper influence on the history of Europe than any
Englishman who has ever lived.”
footnote:[Christopher Dawson, The Making of Europe (New York: Meridian, 1974 (orig. 1932)),185.]

Similarly, the missionary expansion of Christianity in Eastern Europe came
about in the ninth century through the monks Cyril and Methodius, brothers
by blood as well as in their vows. Their willingness to translate the Bible and
liturgical materials into Slavonic, the common language of the region around
Great Moravia and Bohemia, now part of the Czech Republic, was an innova-
tion. It also sealed a bond between Eastern Europe and the Orthodox Church
that remains to this day.

The missionary effectiveness of the monks usually depended as much
upon their plain virtues as upon more highly visible exertions in preaching
or teaching. For a monastery to be established in a pagan area allowed the
local population to see the application of Christianity to daily existence, as
monks tilled the soil, welcomed visitors, and carried out the offices of study
and daily prayer. So arose the saying that the monks civilized Europe 
_cruce, libro, et atro_ —with cross, book, and plow.

In the second half of the Middle Ages, much of the itinerant preaching that
won nominally Christian Europeans to firmer Christian conviction came from
the new orders of mendicant friars (monks on the road, so to speak). The
skillful preaching promoted by the Dominicans and the practical godliness of
the Franciscans both had a great impact. As they ministered to those in im-
mediate surroundings, the friars also maintained earlier monastic concerns
for mission beyond European Christendom. Some of the writings of the Do-
minicans’ greatest theologian, Thomas Aquinas (circa 1225-74), for example,
were designed for use as apologetics to Muslims. For their part, Franciscans
from the time of St. Francis engaged actively in cross-cultural evangelism. A
lay Franciscan, Raymond Lull, was the first Westerner to devise and carry out
a full-fledged mission strategy among Muslims. Lull followed his own advice
that Europeans learn Arabic in order to communicate the gospel in Islamic
regions. His life ended during a fourth mission trip to Muslims, when again
his actions matched his words. “Missionaries will convert the world by preach-
ing, but also through the shedding of tears and blood and with great labour,
and through a bitter death.”
footnote:[Neill, History of Christian Missions, 137.]

### St. Benedict on Choosing an Abbot

[quote, Benedict, Rule]
----
Benedict's care in setting out conditions
for selecting the head of a monastery
reflect many of the characteristics of his
entire Rule:

In choosing an abbot, the guiding principle should always be that
the man placed in office be the one
selected either by the whole community acting unanimously in the fear of
God, or by some part of the community, no matter how small, which possesses sounder judgment. Goodness
of life and wisdom in teaching must
be the criteria for choosing the one to
be made abbot, even if he is the lastin
community rank...

Once in office, the abbot must keep
constantly in mind the nature of the
burden he has received, and remember
to whom he will have to give an account of his stewardship (Luke 16:2].
Let him recognize that his goal must be
profit for the monks, not preeminence
for himself. He ought, therefore, to be
learned in divine law, so that he has a
treasury of knowledge from which he

can bring out what is new and what is.
old [Matt. 13:52]. He must be chaste,
temperate and merciful. He should al-
ways let mercy triumph over judgment
ames 2:13] so that he too may win
mercy. He must hate faults but love the
brothers. When he must punish them,
he should use prudence and avoid ex-
tremes; otherwise, by rubbing too hard
to remove the rust, he may break the
vessel. He is to distrust his own frailty
and remember not to crush the bruised
reed (Isa. 42:3].... Let him strive to be
loved rather than feared.

Excitable, anxious, extreme, obstinate, jealous or oversuspicious he
must not be... . Instead, he must show
forethought and consideration in his
orders, and whether the task he as-
signs concerns God or the world, he
should be discerning and moderate.
Therefore. ..he must so arrange every-
thing that the strong have something
to yearn for and the weak nothing to
run from.

He must, above all, keep this Rule
in every particular.’
footnote:[The Rule of St. Benedict in English, ed.Timothy Fry, OSB (Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 1981), 86-88.]

### Summer Timetable for the Benedictine Monks at Durham,

The monk's daily life is organized around the
‘opus Dei, or’work of God," ‘gathering for com-
munal worship seven times a day based on
Psalm 119:164, Seven times a day I praise
you’ The services include Psalms, hymns, and
readings from Scripture.

- Midnight Matins: in the church (about one hour) Then back to bed.
- 6AM Prime in the church (about 1/2 hour)
- Breakfast

Then to bed, later in summer than in winter

In. winter, Matins was a few hours later, and
other adjustments were made throughout the day.’

### Three Women Writers

#### From Hildegard of Bingen’s vision of the Son of Man

[Your Creator] loves you exceedingly, for
you are His creature; and He gives you
the best of treasures, a vivid intelligence.
He commands you in the words of His
Law to profit from your intellect in good
works, and grow rich in virtue, that He,
the Good Giver, may thereby be clearly

known. Hence you must think every hour
about how to make so great a gift as use-
ful to others as to yourself by works of
justice, so that it will reflect the splendor
of sanctity from you, and people will be
inspired by your good example to praise
and honor God.’
footnote:[Hildegard of Bingen, Scivias, trans. Mother Columba Hart and Jane Bishop (New York: Paulist Press, 1990), 479.]

#### Hadewijch, from her poem“To Learn Mary’s Humility”

The Father in the beginning
Kept his Son, Love,
Hidden in his bosom,

Until Mary,

With deep humility indeed,

In a mysterious way disclosed

him to us.

Then the mountain flowed down into the deep valley,
And that valley flowed aloft to the height of the palace.

Then was the castle conquered

Over which long combat had taken place?
footnote:[Hadewljch, The Complete Works, trans. Mother Columba Hart, OSB (New York: Paulist Press, 1980), 209.]

#### Catherine of Siena, from a letter to Pope Gregory XI urging him
to return the papacy from Avignon to Rome

Answer the summons of God! who is
calling you to come, hold, and possess
the place of the glorious shepherd St.
Peter, whose vicar you are. Lift up the
banner of the holy Cross. Come, that
you may reform the Church with good
shepherds, giving back to her the colour

of most ardent charity that she has lost;
for so much blood has been sucked from
her by wicked devourers that she is pale.
But take heart, and come, Father! Do not
make the servants of God wait, who are
afflicted in longing
footnote:[Quoted in Evelyn Underhill, The Mystics of the Church (Cambridge: James Clarke, 1925; repr., Wilton, CT: Morehouse-Barlow, 1988), 158-59.]


If virtually all cross-cultural proclamation of the gospel in the Middle
Ages was done by monks and friars, so learning a virtually a monastic 
 monopoly. Even in the time of Benedict, other monastic leaders had grasped
 the importance of preserving the critical documents of the Christian past.


Cassiodorus of Rome (circa 485—circa
580) retired from public life in $40
in order to found a monastery, the
Vivarium, along Benedictine lines
where secular as well as Christian
writings could be saved. The Vi-
varium became a widely imitated
model. In the seventh century, a re-
vival of Benedictine monasticism in
England at Lindisfarne, and then
Jarrow, on the eastern coast, lay be-
hind the immense contribution to
biblical, theological, and historical
learning from the Venerable Bede,
who wrote the first history of the
English church. Thomas Aquinas,
it is worth remembering, not only
authored the most important theo-
logical writings of the thirteenth
century but also directed the criti-
cally important exercise of reintro-
ducing Aristotle back into Europe.
This stylized depiction from Asia Minor (now Tur- The way Aquinas carried out that
key) gathers together many of the activities for exercise—with care to discriminate
wich the monks were renowned, those aspects of Aristotle illumi-
nating Christian thinking from those needing to be rebutted or modified
in order to preserve Christian realities—left an example that has guided
Christian interaction with worldly wisdom to the present.

Service in Christ’s name to the world, no less than concern for missions
and learning, characterized monasticism. Benedict’s admonition to shelter the
traveler and care for the sick blossomed into a wide variety of more general
assistance. As one of many possible examples, in 1098 Robert of Molesme
founded a monastery in Citeaux in eastern France on the basis of the purified
Rule of Benedict. The Cistercians (or White Monks, because of their dress) that
spread from Citeaux were notable for their strict internal discipline and also
for locating new monasteries in wild, difficult locations. Cistercian efforts at
surviving in such places eventually led to considerable skill at draining swamps,
clearing forests, breeding cattle and sheep, and raising grains appropriate to
their new locales. These skills, in turn, were eventually passed on to surround-
ing communities, with beneficial results for all. Not much more than a century

[page 95]

after the founding of the Cistercians, St. Francis’s dedication to the poor, the
sick, and the disabled propelled the Franciscan order into the forefront of
humane service offered to the Europeans least able to help themselves.

Finally, the cycles of monastic renewal, decay, and renewal again came
more or less to define cycles of general revival and decline in the church. Most
notably, a period of striking ecclesiastical degeneration in the ninth and tenth
centuries was challenged, and then reversed, through a series of administrative
and spiritual reforms associated with the founding of a monastery at Cluny in
southern France in the year 909. Then, as the effects of this monastic renewal
began to be felt over the next century and a half, even to the highest reaches
of the Vatican, another set of monastic foundations sparked another surge of
renewal. In the late eleventh century, just about the same time that Robert of
Molesme established the monastery in Citeaux, Bruno of Cologne founded
a monastery at La Grande Chartreuse only a short distance to the east, from
which eventually came the Carthusian order. The Carthusians combined the
eremetic (individual cells) and the cenobitic (common meals) in encouraging
fresh devotion, contemplation, and ascetic practices. The extraordinarily
important work of Bernard of Clairvaux in the twelfth century—as promoter of spirituality, author of hymns, defender of orthodoxy, and assistant
to popes—flowed out of the spirit represented by the foundations at Citeaux
and La Grande Chartreuse. Again, the emergence of the Dominicans and
Franciscans in the thirteenth century sparked another cycle of renewal in the
life, thought, and service of the church.

This brief sketch of medieval monastic history should not be taken to mean
that Christianity existed only within monastic circles, nor that monastic life
always avoided decay and corruption. In fact, nonmonastic support, whether
by donations from rich nobles or the willingness of poor families to send sons
or daughters into the monastic life, played an important part in fueling the
dynamism of monasticism. But when all necessary qualifications have been
made, it remains true that the immense range, depth, and spiritual vigor of
monasticism was the driving force of the Christian faith for a very long time
indeed. In that sense, Benedict’s pivotal role in the history of monasticism is
more than enough to qualify the promulgation of his Rule as one of the great
turning points in the history of Christianity.

 

### A Few Words of Evaluation

Assessment of monasticism by a Protestant will naturally reflect more general
Protestant principles. Thus, Protestant convictions about the centrality of justification by faith are bound to raise questions about whether monasticism
encouraged harmful notions concerning the possibility of salvation by works.
Clearly, moments of monastic renewal were inspired as thoroughly by trust in
divine grace and dedication to God’s unique holiness as any moments in the
later history of Protestantism. But whether in ordinary monastic times the stress
on what the monks had vowed to do did not obscure the foundational reality of
God’s grace is a question that any Christian might legitimately raise. To be sure,
a Protestant cannot raise such a question with an entirely clear conscience, since
the history of Protestantism reveals a bent toward legalism, in which various
things that Protestants are or are not supposed to do or believe have become
as much substitutes for the gospel of grace as any wayward monasticism. But
questions regarding the centrality of grace are questions that monasticism
will always hear especially from the Protestant family of Western Christians.

The most serious theological questions about monasticism are not, however,
restricted to a Protestant provenance. They concern, rather, basic realities
fundamental to all sorts of Christians. First, does ascetic privation of the
body affect the true seat of sinfulness? Granting the Christian mandate to do
all things “in a fitting and orderly way” (1 Cor. 14:40) and the reality of the
bond between flesh and spirit underscored by the incarnation, it is possible to
suggest that the bent of the heart, rather than the mere disposal of the body,
is the key matter in godliness.

If so, a second question surfaces. Does the incarnation of Christ, with
the full humanity affirmed by Chalcedon, justify withdrawal from the world
in the way that monks practiced this withdrawal? The argument that it does
not grows out of the New Testament observations that, unlike the disciples
of John, Jesus’s disciples came mingling with sinners as well as eating and
drinking. It remains one of the most striking passages of the Gospels to read
in John 2:11 that Jesus revealed “his glory” through his first miracle, at Cana
of Galilee, by turning water into wine and thereby enabling a wedding feast
to go on. If the Son of God did such a thing to promote joyful celebration
with the body (though, of course, within limits of moderation) and joyful
celebration of marriage (though, of course, it is not recorded that Jesus ever
married), we have at least a hint that celibate, ascetic life is not intrinsically
mote godly than wedded, celebratory life.

A historian, however, even a Protestant historian of Reformed leanings
who thinks that life in ordinary society and married sexuality are gifts of God
to be highly prized, will raise questions about the theological justification of
monasticism only with diffidence. What a historian will see in looking back is
that, almost by themselves, monks for more than a thousand years sustained
what was most noble and most Christ-centered in the church. A historian must

[page 97]

also recognize that the holiness of monastic life—though never perfect, always
in need of reform, and occasionally sunk in corruption—remains today, more
than seventeen hundred years after Antony went into the desert, a guide and
inspiration to large sections of the Christian church. That recognition will
temper, though not eliminate entirely, theological questions about the implications of the incarnation and ideals of the Christian life. That recognition,
whatever lingering qualms it may carry for a Protestant, is enough to certify
the emergence of the monasticism represented by Benedict’s Rule as not only
acritical turning point in the history of Christianity but even, by God’s grace,
the very rescue of the church itself.

Although Benedict was recognized and revered early on as a major spiritual figure in the
church, it was his Rule, and not his personal life, that was paramount. Gregory the Great
wrote of Benedict that “if anyone would like to get the true picture of this man of God let
him go to the Rule he has written, for the holy man could not have taught anything but
what he had first lived.” The following twentieth-century collect (or short, concise prayer)
expresses Benedict’s enduring influence on many, both lay and monastic, who look to the
Rule as a guide to the disciplined Christian life.
