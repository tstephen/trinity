## Methodism and the Evangelical Revival

The Hanoverian Church of England, despite its redeeming
qualities, stood sorely in need of reform. The age of reason
had forgotten certain fundamental human needs; natural
religion might satisfy the minds of some, but the hearts of
multitudes were hungry. The weaknesses of the established
church - its failure to provide adequate care, the inflexibility
of its parish system, its neglect of the new towns — left a vast
and needy population waiting to be touched by a new word
of power. ‘Just at this time, when we wanted little of
“filling up the measure of our iniquities”, two or three
clergymen of the Church of England began vehemently to
“call sinners to repentance”’. In two or three years they had
sounded the alarm to the utmost borders of the land. Many
thousands gathered to hear them; and in every place where
they came, many began to show such a concern for religion
as they never had done before,’ This is Wesley’s own account
of the beginnings of the Methodist revival.

John Wesley was born in 1703 in the Lincolnshire rectory
of Epworth. His father was a man of ability — ardent,
opinionated, impractical; a poet as well as an irrepressible
controversialist, an unbending churchman, and an unyielding Tory. His mother was a remarkable woman by any
standard. To great natural ability she united a strong sense
of duty and of her responsibility as the mother of a large
family, Her system of child training was stern in its simplicity. The first essential was to break the unregenerate will
of a child; the second, to guide him by strict discipline in
the way in which he ought to go. The system is theoretically
defective; it produced John and Charles Wesley.

John went to Christ Church, Oxford, and in due course
became a fellow of Lincoln College. Charles followed him to
Christ Church, and was responsible for assembling the little
band of seekers known as the ‘Holy Club’. Its members met
regularly for fellowship, for Bible study, and for prayer. They
were faithful in attendance at the ordinances of the church,
and pledged themselves to assist the needy and the destitute.
Oxford was predominantly a clerical community; that such
a programme should have provoked ridicule is a revealing
commentary on the condition of the Hanoverian church.

The members of the Holy Club were ardent and unsatisfied. In search of more exacting service, the Wesleys set sail
for Oglethorpe’s new colony of Georgia. At this stage, John
Wesley was an unyielding rigorist. He had no mercy on himself, nor on others. He had not found peace within, he
created enmity about him, and was virtually driven from
the colony. He brought back to England his sense of insufficiency, now fortified by the knowledge that he had miserably
failed. For some time he floundered about in search of light.
Both on shipboard and in Georgia he had met, and been
profoundly impressed by, the Moravians. In London, one
of their number continued the work already begun, and at
length, on 24 May 1738, the light broke in upon John
Wesley’s soul. ‘In the evening’, he wrote, ‘I went very unwillingly to a society in Aldersgate Street, where one was
reading Luther’s preface to the Epistle to the Romans. About
a quarter to nine, while he was describing the change which
God works in the heart through faith in Christ, I felt my
heart strangely warmed, I felt that I did trust in Christ,
Christ alone, for salvation; and an assurance was given me
that he had taken away my sins, even mine, and saved me
from the law of sin and death.’

In Wesley’s Journal there immediately follows this comment: ‘I then testified openly to all there what I now first
felt in my heart.’ He had found his message. He had not yet
found his method. With monotonous regularity he discovered
that the doors of the parish churches were closed against
him. Wherever he preached, he was informed that he need
not return. His orbit seemed to be steadily contracting. It
was George Whitefield, a friend of the Holy Club days, who
showed him the way ahead and helped him to find a new
and marvellous medium. If he could not preach in the
churches, why not preach in the fields? ‘At four in the afternoon,’ Wesley records in his Journal on 2 April 1739, ‘I submitted to be more vile, and proclaimed in the highways the
glad tidings of salvation, speaking from a little eminence . . .
to about three thousand people. The scripture from which I
spoke was this . . . “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, be=
cause he hath anointed me to preach the Gospel to the poor.
He hath sent me to heal the broken-hearted; to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind;
to set at liberty them that are bruised, to proclaim the
acceptable year of the Lord.” ’

Thus begins one of the most remarkable episodes in the
history of the church, Page after page, the sober prose of the
Journal unfolds the marvellous story. John Wesley set out to
carry the Gospel to people wherever they were willing to
listen, and experience showed that throughout the length
and breadth of the land they were waiting for such a
preacher. ‘In journeyings oft. ..’, said the Apostle, and
Wesley might have echoed his words. A conservative
calculation suggests that he covered a quarter of a million miles
in days when travelling was both difficult and dang
He preached to unnumbered multitudes. Two, three, five,
ten thousand ~ these were by no means exceptional congregations; sometimes the figures rose to twenty and even
thirty thousand. He preached in the streets or in the churchyards, in the fields or on the moors, He could always gather
an audience, but he could not always gain a hearing.
Crowds were often hostile, sometimes dangerous. Roi
stones or other missiles would come flying at the pr
sometimes he was mobbed’ and beaten. There was much
in the second half of the eighteenth century. Food was scarce, prices were high, and often the
prevalent discontent vented itself on the Methodist preachers. Sometimes it was incited against them by hostile
squires or parsons. But Wesley feared not the face of man.
By a strange personal magnetism he awed the turbulent
crowds and constrained them to silence.  Even when driven
out, he never hesitated to return, As a record of indomitable
courage there are few narratives that can match it.

Both Wesley and Whitefield were preachers of extraordinary power. In his ability to sway an audience, Whitefield
was supreme. He won the admiration of David Garrick,
perhaps the ablest exponent of the art of rhetoric in an age
of magnificent orators. He commanded the attention, if not
the assent, of worldlings as hardened as the cynical Earl of
Chesterfield. Wesley’s power is more difficult to understand,
His sermons, so closely reasoned, so massive in their doctrinal structure, bear little resemblance to what our age
would consider popular preaching. Yet he could collect a
congregation at any hour of the day. By preference he
preached at five o’clock in the morning, but at night — even
amid the violence of a thunderstorm — his hearers hung
upon his words with absorbed attention. The preaching of
both leaders produced the most dramatic results. As emotion.
swept the crowd, some confessed themselves sinners; some
shouted that they were kings; some broke into songs of
thanksgiving; some were seized with convulsions. ‘While I
was preaching,’ records Wesley, ‘one before me dropped
down as dead, and presently a second or a third. Five others
sank down in half an hour, most of whom were in violent
agonies. We called upon the Lord and he gave us an answer
of peace.’ A brutalized age, long deprived of any outlet for
religious emotions, reacted strongly to the new preaching,
and it is not surprising that Hanoverian clerics looked
askance at such manifestations of the Spirit.

In the early days of the revival, Wesley and Whitefield
were joint leaders in a common task. They had had the same
experience, they shared the same enthusiasm, they used the
same methods. But they did not hold the same beliefs.
Whitefield was a Calvinist, Wesley was not. Calvinism,
which exalts the absolute sovereignty of God, claims that in
his inscrutable wisdom he has ordained to salvation only
those whom he selects. Arminianism, on the other hand,
leaves far greater scope for man’s free will. Wesley was a
convinced Arminian. He held firmly to the belief that ‘God
willeth all men to be saved’. Whitefield viewed such beliefs
with dismay. In A Letter to the Rev. Mr John Wesley (1752),
he claimed that because Wesley had misunderstood the
doctrine of election he had fallen into the heresy of universal
redemption. To Whitefield it was clear that Arminianism
dulled the all-important sense of sin; it made men complacent,
whereas election tended to ‘rouse the soul out its
carnal security’, Was Wesley right, he asked, in holding
that Calvinism killed all hope and led to indifference? Did
not the contrary view surrender the vital concept of an
almighty God? This was a debate between great men, both
deeply concerned about great issues, In his blunt way,
Wesley once told his friend that ‘your God is my devil’,
Because they were great men, they parted in charity, but the
debate was continued by lesser men in a more vindictive
spirit, and had lasting results on the course of the evangelical
revival.

Wesley differed from Whitefield in doctrine and was distinctly his inferior in the arts of pure oratory, but as an
organizer he was supreme. In this area his gifts were
transcendent, and lifted him into that select company to whom
the over-worked term ‘genius’ can properly be applied.
Wherever Whitefield went he left an overwhelming impression of impassioned eloquence; wherever Wesley went he
left a company of men and women closely knit together in
a common life, At an early stage he realized the importance
of organization. Even in Georgia, he recommended his more
earnest hearers ‘to form themselves into a sort of little
society, to meet once or twice in a week, in order to reprove,
instruct, and exhort one another’. This method was
promptly applied to his expanding work in England. In
Bristol, in 1742, the members of the Society decided to
divide themselves into classes of about twelve each and to
appoint leaders to be responsible for oversight and for the
receipt of ‘class money’ (a penny a week), The pattern thus
established was adopted wherever Methodism spread, In
the following year, Wesley set forth a code of rules for his
followers, which laid on each of them the duty of resisting
evil, of doing good wherever possible, and of attending the
ordinances, and he ‘desired everyone seriously to consider
whether he was willing to conform thereto or no’. Here was
the basis for the discipline which became so characteristic
of the movement. A year later, we have the genesis of the
Conference — originally a consultation about increasing
problems and responsibilities, soon a powerful part of the
system of government, In 1746 a further step was taken, and
neighbouring societies were formed into ‘circuits or rounds’.
Quarterly meetings were added in due course, and when
Districts were set up the system was complete.

A closely knit organization and a strong central government were thus characteristic of Methodism from the beginning. The measure of personal authority wielded by Wesley
himself was immense, but perhaps the notable feature of the
system was the degree to which it developed lay leadership.
The class leaders, stewards, trustees, and local preachers
gained experience of administration and grew in stature.
The qualifications for office did not put responsibility beyond the reach of humble folk, and gave the movement a
firm foundation in popular support. Regular business meetings at every level of activity unified ‘the connexion’, and
simplified the task of supervision. Every member was drawn
into a corporate life whose extension depended upon his
regular financial support.

Methodism had embarked upon a bold experiment.
Necessity, reinforced by conviction, made Wesley rely increasingly on the gifts and capacities lying dormant in the
average man. But this meant that he had to train his people,
and often they had to be taught the simplest duties of the
Christian life. This accounts for the strict discipline, corporate as well as personal, which Wesley enforced. In his
private life, each member had to conform to an exacting
standard. He was pledged to various forms of religious
activity ~ regular reading of the Bible, the practice of public
and private prayer, full participation in the varied activities
of the society, and the conversion of others to his way of life.
He was given direction concerning food and drink, clothing
and ornaments, forms of self-indulgence, the use of money,
buying and selling, the observance of the Sabbath, and
attendance at church. The conscience of the individual was
reinforced by the concern of the class meeting. Each member
was expected to report his victories or defeats, and his way
of life was subjected to searching scrutiny. As he advanced
in responsibility he was expected to submit to an increasingly stringent discipline. The penalty for failure was expulsion, and this was no empty threat. At Newcastle, in 1743,
Wesley read the rules, and proceeded to exclude sixty-four
members, guilty of cursing, swearing, Sabbath-breaking,
drunkenness, quarrelling and brawling, wife-beating, lying,
railing, idleness and laziness, lightness and carelessness,
Rigorous discipline was the counterpart of the human
material which Wesley was trying to reform. He himself.
never questioned either the necessity of the method or the
benefits which it produced. Wherever discipline was enforced, numbers rose and spiritual vitality increased,

The nature of his constituency determined the character
of his programme. He went by choice to the needy and
neglected. Beyond any of his contemporaries, he knew the
poor and loved them. He spoke with withering scorn of the
selfish ostentation of the rich, but ‘I love the poor,” he said;
‘in many of them I find pure genuine grace, unmixed with
paint, folly, and affectation.’ Many of his enterprises were
inspired by their needs. ‘All my leisure hours this week,’
he records in 1783, ‘I am employed in visiting the . . . poor
and in begging for them.’ He raised considerable sums: of
money in order to buy necessities, which he often distributed
in person. When well past eighty, he spent four days on such
a mission, trudging through streets ‘ filled with melting snow,
which often lay ankle deep, so that my feet were steeped in
snow water . . . from morning till evening’. He opened a dispensary ‘for many of the poor that were sick’. He started a
loan society to tide needy people over temporary distress or
to launch them on some enterprise that promised a better
way of life. He founded a home for widows and a school for
poor children. He even recognized that poverty was not
merely ‘a sore evil’, but a social problem with which the
government ought to be concerned, and in his Thoughts on
the Present Scarcity of Provisions (1773), he suggested practical
measures which it might adopt.

Lack of money was the problem of some; the possession
of it was the problem of others, and Wesley gave much
thought to the subject of wealth and its proper use. Because
Methodism converted men to lives of sobriety and industry,
the members of the society prospered. Wesley did not regard
the acquisition of wealth as wrong, especially when it was
the result of honest industry, He certainly regarded it as
dangerous, and he viewed with concern the growing prosperity of his people. ‘I went on to Macclesfield,’ he writes,
‘and found a people still alive to God, in spite of swiftly
increasing riches, If they continue so, it will be the first
instance I have known in above half a century. I warned
them in the strongest terms I could. . .” His own practice
was strict. ‘For upward of eighty-six years I have kept my
accounts exactly. I will not attempt it any lohger, being
satisfied . . . that I save all I can, and give all I can—that is,
all I have

In politics Wesley was a Tory, a loyal subject of the
Hanoverian kings, and a firm believer in the system of
government inaugurated by the Revolution of 1688. Much
has been written of his part in saving England from the kind
of upheaval which convulsed France at the close of the
century. But there was no close parallel between conditions
on the two sides of the Channel. England had had a constitutional revolution, and the economic life of the country
was already being transformed. This does not depreciate the
role Wesley played in reaching the poor of England. ‘There
were thousands of men and women in Manchester and
Leeds’, wrote the Hammonds, ‘who found self-respect and.
contentment in the duties and dreams of their religion.’ The
loyalty which Wesley inculcated in his members gave them
a solidity which was of some significance in a disturbed
period, and which predisposed them to support the more
gradual processes of reform which in the next century
transformed English public life. And when preaching the
duties of good citizenship, Wesley was resolute in attacking the
abuses which he recognized in public life. With every means
at his disposal he opposed bribery and corruption in politics. He campaigned ceaselessly against the press gang, and
insisted that no Methodist should have any part in smuggling or in the plundering of wrecked vessels. Nor should his
unflinching stand against slavery be overlooked.

In certain directions his influence was used to more
dubious effect. His views on toleration were restricted by his
dislike of popery and his fear ofits influence. In this he shared
the attitude of a generation which clung too tenaciously to
the fears rekindled by James II, and on this question his
views were those of his great contemporary, the Earl of
Chatham, In education his lack of imagination gave him
little understanding of the young. In his school at Kingswood, the pupils’ day began at 4 a.m., but in a curriculum
crammed with every conceivable subject, he allowed no
time at all for play. Here again Wesley shared the limitations of his age, and it is not fair to judge Hanoverian practices by modern theories. It is only right to remember that
few men in his period did more to promote the cause of
education — and to add that his practice was better than his
principles. On one point contemporary accounts agree: his
great love of little children and his power to attract them.
Methodism began among poor people; its advance was built
upon the pennies they contributed. This accounts for its
indifference to art, to music, and to literature. In these
areas it was almost wholly sterile, with one very notable
exception. The hymns of the movement were its greatest
glory. They explain the power of its appeal, and constitute
its most revealing record. Charles Wesley left an imperishable legacy not only to Methodism but to the whole Christian world.

Methodism sprang up within the Church of England, and
Wesley was determined that it should never separate from
it. Early in his ministry, when ‘a serious clergyman’ asked
‘in what points’ the Methodists differed from the Church,
Wesley answered, “In none.’ ‘The doctrines we preach’, he
added, ‘are the doctrines of the Church of England; indeed,
the fundamental doctrines of the church, laid down in her
prayers, articles, and homilies.’ ‘I live and die a member of
the Church of England,’ he said. ‘None who regard my
judgement or advice will ever separate from it.” Nor were
these isolated statements; they can be multiplied times without number, and resolutions of the conference reinforced
them. There is a deep pathos but a certain inevitability
about the final breach. The Hanoverian Church was ill
equipped to deal with such a phenomenon as Methodism.
The reaction of the bishops was varied. Gibson was cautious, aware of difficulties, but anxious not to condemn,
Archbishop Potter was cordial. ‘Mr Wesley,’ said Bishop
Lowth, ‘may I be found sitting at your feet in another
world.’ Many of the bishops were outspoken in their opposition. Warburton wrote a strong attack on the Methodist
doctrine of grace, and on Wesley as the ablest proponent of
the dangerous new trend in religion. Bishop Butler was also
hostile; his famous rebuke (‘Sir, the pretending to extraordinary revelations and gifts of the Holy Ghost is a horrid
thing ~ a very horrid thing’) shows how far removed in spirit
a great Hanoverian churchman could be from the new
movement. There was no unanimity among the bishops because there was no concerted policy in the church, Convocation was in abeyance, and consequently none could be
framed. In any case, attention was concentrated on other:
things; many highly placed’ ecclesiastics were absorbed in
the intricacies of place-hunting, and they did not see that
Methodism was a challenge to the church. As the new
societies expanded, they developed the characteristics of.
congregations. Many of their members, snatched from indifference and irreligion, had no attachment to the established church, and desired none. The developing life of the
movement became less and less dependent on the church; in
spite of everything that Wesley said, many of his followers
were content that it should be so. The severance of Methodism
from the church was the consequence of Wesley’s acceptance
of an apostolate to the growing industrial population which
was virtually untouched by Anglican ministrations. But the
church could not overlook Wesley’s claim to disregard parish
boundaries; still less could it admit his right to ordain.
Wesley had become increasingly perturbed at the failure of
the church to provide adequate ministrations in the colonies;
study and reflection persuaded him that presbyters could
legitimately ordain. Consequently he embarked ona course
that his own church could not countenance. The separation
between Anglicanism and Methodism may have been inevitable; it is impossible not to regard it with profound
regret.

Many features of the Methodist revival can be explained
in terms of the needs of the time and the gifts of the man who.
was raised up to meet them. In both social and religious
matters England was ready to listen to Wesley’s message. He
came with the assurance that God’s forgiveness was available
toall: the power of a new life could be had for the asking, The
flexibility of his method and the novelty of preaching in the
open air gave the widest currency to the good news he
brought, while his superb gifts of organization conserved the
results which he achieved. But to Wesley himself such explanations would have seemed irrelevant. In his eightieth
year he himself found the secret of his ministry chiefly in
‘the power of God, fitting me for what he calls me to’. He
was persuaded that his whole life and every detail of it were
under the immediate direction of God. And in the response
of the people he found confirmation of this same power. ‘The
drunkard’, wrote Wesley, “commenced sober and temperate; the whore-monger abstained from adultery and fornica=
tion, the unjust from oppression and wrong. He that had
been accustomed to curse and swear for many years, now
swore no more, The sluggard began to work with his hands,
that he might eat his own bread. The miser learned to deal
his bread to the hungry, and to cover the naked with a
garment. Indeed, the whole of their life was changed: they
had left off doing evil and learned to do well.” A Methodist,
said Wesley, is ‘happy in God, yea, always happy’; a quality
which survives in the songs of the movement was first expressed in the lives of its members. One of the most satisfactory accounts of the dynamic quality of Methodism is
Wesley’s description of the Yorkshire societies in 1751. ‘I
found them all alive, strong, vigorous of soul, blessing, loving
and praising God their Saviour. ... From the beginning
they had been taught both the law and the gospel. “God
loves you: therefore love and obey Him. Christ died for you:
therefore die to sin. Christ is risen: therefore rise in the
image of God. Christ liveth evermore: therefore live to God,
till you live with him in glory.”? So we preached; and so you
believed. This is the scriptural way, the Methodist way, the
true way. God grant we may never turn from it, to the right
hand or to the left.’ .

The evangelical revival cannot be equated with the
Methodist movement, still less with the life of the Wesleyan
societies. Whitefield, after parting company with Wesley on
doctrine, continued to work along parallel lines, though with
more ephemeral results. After his comparatively early death,
Calvinistic Methodism was most prominently represented by
the Countess of Huntingdon. She undertook to commend
Methodism to the upper classes; in addition she claimed the
right as a peeress to appoint as her chaplains clergymen
willing to work on behalf of Methodism, These men, were,
of course, predominantly priests of the Church of England,
since Methodism was still a movement, not a denomination.
But the Countess also had close relations with nonconformity.
Her theological college at Trevecca trained clergy both for
the church and for the dissenting bodies. Her chaplains
exerted a wider influence than their numbers would have
suggested, and her practices were challenged. In 1779 the
consistory court of London disallowed her claim that she
could appoint to the rank of chaplain, and use in public
ministrations, as many Anglican priests as she desired. She
thereupon registered her chapels as dissenting meeting
houses, and ‘the Countess of Huntingdon’s Connexion’ became a nonconformist body. In one more respect the ties
between Anglicanism and Methodism were severed.

Methodism began within the established church. Whitefield and Wesley were Anglican priests, and their aim was
to revitalize the church, Many clergymen who were influenced by their example did not identify themselves with
their movement. Samuel Walker of Truro, who was largely
responsible for a notable revival in western Cornwall,
gathered his converts into societies similar to those of
Wesley, Grimshaw of Haworth and Berridge of Everton
were itinerant evangelists as well as parish priests. Like the
Methodists, they emphasized the need for a vital spiritual
religion. They believed that the immediate action of the
Holy Spirit leads men through conversion to a holy life,
Their theological affinities were with Whitefield rather than
with Wesley. Toplady (author of Rock of Ages, and of many
vigorous polemical works) was a vehement Calvinist, The
Evangelicals accepted the total depravity of man: of his own
will, he cannot turn to God, and restoration to divine favour
can be effected by Christ alone. They were opposed both to
the meagre theology of their age and to the unabashed worldliness of the Hanoverian Church. Bluntly and without qualification they proclaimed the great evangelical doctrines,

These men were in conscious revolt against many of the
characteristic aspects of their age. Their protest against its
frivolity intensified the puritanical strain so congenial to
their Calvinistic outlook. They condemned cards, theatres,
dancing, and all amusements that savoured of dissipation,
They kept steadily in the forefront of their thought the high
seriousness of life and the dread solemnity of death, and they
insisted that the demands both of time and of eternity can
be met victoriously only by those who rely completely upon
divine aid.

They combined this strength with its less admirable
tlements. They developed an almost morbid preoccupation
with death. In their reaction against rationalism they allowed unfettered scope to the emotions. Because the prevalent theology had developed Latitudinarian, even Socinian,
lendencies, they deprecated intellectual pursuits and relied
nan uncritical Biblical literalism. Asaresult, the evangelical
movement proved comparatively sterile as a theological
force. Stock phrases supplanted reasoned arguments, and a
distinctive idiom became the badge of piety.

In the closing years of the eighteenth century, the Evangelicals made rapid headway. John Newton, William Romaine, and Thomas Scott were active in London; so were
Richard Cecil and Basil Wood. Bishop Beilby Porteus
encouraged them, and. in increasing numbers the clergy of
the capital associated themselves with the movement. At
Oxford they were weak, at Cambridge strong. Isaac Milner,
the President of Queens’, was a notable figure both in the
university and beyond it. Charles Simeon, a fellow off
King’s, exercised a highly influential ministry at Holy
Trinity Church. At Cambridge, and increasingly throughout the Church of England, religious earnestness found a
congenial home in the Evangelical party. Not many of its
members were in positions of power, but by the end of the
century it had established itself as the most active and
aggressive group in the church.

‘The Evangelicals, unlike the Methodists, remained within
the church, but they emphasized only one aspect of its
teaching, and attached little value to methods on which ii
had always relied. In their intense preoccupation with the
salvation of the individual, they minimized the corporate
life of the church. But they proved that men and women can
be converted to a new life and can be sustained in true
godliness. Nor was their influence a doctrinaire and other-
worldly force. They were devoted to good works, and showed
that the Gospel which transformed individuals can profoundly affect society as well.

This growing awareness of Christian responsibility for th
weak and the destitute inspired some of the notable
movements which flourished during the closing years of our
period. The crusade against the slave trade represents
perhaps the greatest victory of the awakened Christian
conscience over a strongly entrenched evil. In the long, slow
process of exposing the traffic in human lives the Quaker
played a distinguished part, but the contribution of the
'Clapham Sect' (a group of earnest and influential Evangelicals)
was decisive. The slave trade was firmly established
and powerfully supported. It had been an axiom of British
policy that the prosperity of the country — the expansion of
its manufacturing, shipping, and colonial trade — required
active participation in this traffic. The trade in slaves had
been sanctioned by three seventeenth-century charters; it
had been legalized by an Act of Parliament in 1698;
Britain's share had been augmented by treaties in 1713,
1725, and 1748. The African Company was described as ‘the
most beneficial to this island of all the companies that ever
were formed by our merchants’. The trade had been pushed
with considerable success. During the century before 1786,
the British alone transported at least 2,000,000 negroes AS
the new world. All the other maritime nations — the French,
the Portuguese, the Dutch, the Danes, and the New
Englanders ~ had a share in the traffic. But finally an age
not unduly sensitive to human suffering was shocked by the
horrors: of ‘the middle passage’ and by the rigours of the
plantation system. The rising tide of humanitarian feeling
began to protest. Some of the most distinguished men of the
day challenged the commercial interests involved. In 1787,
the Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade was
formed, and Grenville Sharp, Clarkson, Zachary Macaulay,
and William Wilberforce were prominent members, A committee of
the Privy Council collected a great deal of information about
the traffic, and in 1788 William Pitt, in Wilberforce’s
absence through illness, raised the subject in the
House of Commons, Repeal was delayed by the preoccupations of
war as well as by fear that unilateral action would
merely benefit England’s rivals. Victory tarried; the persistence
of Wilberforce and his associates guaranteed ultimate
success. This was a notable triumph of the Christian conscience,
and its origins, as well as the spirit which sustained
the long endeavour, are revealed in Wilberforce’s famous
work, A Practical View of the Prevailing Religious Systems. This
popular book was the most influential manifesto of the
Evangelical party.

The work of Hannah More illustrates another aspect of
Evangelical zeal. Before her conversion, this able woman
had been a prominent literary and social figure. Her growing
interest in ‘serious Christianity’ found expression in
Thoughts on the Importance of the Manners of the Great to General
Society (1788), a courageous work which had an appreciable
effect on social customs. Wilberforce directed her attention
to the conditions which prevailed in the villages of the
Mendip Hills. The labourers were ignorant and poverty stricken;
the more substantial farmers were despotic and
overbearing; the clergy were indifferent and indolent. In
thirteen adjoining communities there was not a single 
resident clergyman of any kind. To combat the prevailing
ignorance and vice, Hannah More and her sister established
schools, first for the children, then for the adults, At every
turn they encountered an opposition bred of superstition
and fear. The courage of these women, as well as their
enlightened and disinterested enthusiasm, reflected the
evangelical spirit in its most attractive guise.

In many other areas the Evangelicals were active. They
helped to establish the Church Missionary Society, the
Religious Tract Society, and the British and Foreign Bible
Society. Their spirit was sometimes narrow and their sympathies circumscribed, but at one point after another their
influence stimulated and guided the Christian conscience.
