## Background Factors/Events

- sharp denominational divisions at end of the 19^th^ C
- an awakening to the ridiculousness of these divisions due to the need to evangelise the whole church
- genuine coming together in the first part of the 20^th^ C culminating in the foundation of the World Council of Churches after the second world war.
- still encounter some of this, but even Catholics in 2^nd^ Vatican council acknowledge such as closed Bretheren were Christian worshipping the same God.

## War!

* Slaughter of WWI - 9 million soldiers, 7 million civilians.
* Slaughter of WWII — est. 50-80 million, most of whom were non-combatants

In WW1, although conflict went right around the world, fighting and deaths concentrated in northern Europe. Conscription led to more families to be affected.

In WWI, most deaths did not lead to repatriation of the bodies, so most bereavements could not
be responded to with a funeral. It was this which led the many parishes in Church of England to
reinstate prayers for the departed.

God is ‘on our side’? Most national churches fell in behind their army. 

Hence, after war, a rise of the 'cult of the dead soldier-martyr':
use of John 15:13 (“greater love hath no man”), without much thought or theological foundation.

Inter-war years: thinking about horror of war, rise of pacifism, critical theological reflection. Seeing one's enemy as another human being and perhaps even another Christian.

In Germany, prior to the 20^th^ C, the role of church and state had always been very close, following Luther.
Luther himself developed the 'Two Kingdoms' theology of church and state working together in their respective sheres, but never really communicating.
The Manifesto of the Ninety-Three — backing the Kaiser’s war policy — including:

- Adolf Deissmann,
- Adolf von Harnack,
- Wilhelm Herrmann, and
- Reinhold Seeberg.

This ability to endorse murder prompted Karl Barth’s to see something intrinsically wrong in their theology. Ultimately he rejected their liberal theology, even though he himself was schooled in it, instead defining a theology that was not relativ to human context and started with God.

In the 1930s: rise of the Nazis to power, the German Lutheran Church was largely passive.
Most actively supportive were the “German Christians” (Deutsche Christen) who promoted:

* antisemitic reading of the New Testament
* de-judaizing of the Old Testament
* support for Nazi myths of arianism and German superiority

This was opposed by the Confessing Church, who actively opposed Nazification of the faith.
Key leaders of the Confessing Church:

* Pastor Martin Niemdller
* Heinrich Gruber
* Dietrich Bonhoeffer
* Karl Barth (until his deposition from his Professorship at the University of Bonn—
since an oath of allegiance to Hitler was a pre-req to public office—
and move to the University of Basel, in his native Switzerland)

Barth was the key drafter of the Barmen Declaration, which declared the independence of the
Church from the State and criticised State interference in Church affairs, as Jesus Christ is the only
Lord of the Church.

Niemdller, Griiber and Bonhoeffer were sent to concentration camps.
Bonhoeffer was executed in 1945.

In Britain, in the 1930s, the bishop of Chichester, George Bell, maintained contacts with the
Confessing Church through his close friend Dietrich Bonhoeffer. Bell himself signed the Barmen
Declaration and got the backing of the bishops of the Church of England for the Confessing Church.
Important after the war to evidence that not all Germans were Nazis and to prevent the writing off of the whole of Germany. 
During the war, Bell strongly and publicly criticized indiscriminate bombing of cities by the RAF and
also supported the welfare of German POWs and conscientious objectors.
He was strongly criticized for doing this and may well have contributed
to his beign passed over for ABC after Temple.

Conscientious Objectors: a highly contentious position in WWI.
The majority were Quakers. They
were put to other duties to support the nation, if not the war effort. 
Other Christian conscientious objectors included the Plymouth Brethren. 
Was legally permitted in both wars after conscription introduced.

The Cold War: the advent of nuclear weapons accentuated the moral
questions of exterminating millions of non-combatants, children included,
in the incineration of a nuclear and thermonuclear explosion.
In Britain, Christians of all denominations were at the forefront of the
foundation of CND and participants in the Aldermaston Marches of the
1950s to protest at Britain’s nuclear weapons.

* During 1980s, CND was led by Monsignor Bruce Kent
* 1982, Church of England’s Board for Social Responsibility produced
The Church and the Bomb — affirmed that nuclear war could not be
acceptable under Christian just war thinking
and advocated unilateral disarmament. Synod accepted most of this but not the unilateral disarmament part.

The facts of the 20^th^ century indicate that Christians are often
divided on the issue of war and weapons.
A single view seems elusive, although the relationship of nuclear
weapons to traditional just war theory is a matter for ongoing concern.

## The Holy Spirit, Pentecostals and Charismatics

Little work on the Holy Spirit in the medieval and reformation periods. cf. The BCP. In contrast to the very active ministry of the HS in Orthodoxy.

Regular outbreaks of charismata in revivals, but isolated to place and
time. eg. Under Edward Irving in 1830s in Scotland (Irving ministered at Church of Scotland church in London). Developed theology for ongoing manifestation of gifts and expelled from ministry shortly after permitting charismata in his church.

### Pentecostal Roots:

* 1901 - speaking in tongues in Bethel Bible School, Topeka, Kansas, under its principal,
Charles Parham, in January 1901.
* 1906 - Azusa Street Revival under William J Seymour who followed his teacher (Parham) in
proclaiming a second stage of initiation — the Baptism with the Spirit. It remains, along with
the insistence of evidence by tongues, a core doctrine of Pentecostal churches.
Unusually for US at the time, experienced by a church of both black and white.

### Early influence in the UK:

* Charles Boddy—Anglian minister in Sunderland—
pentecostal experience came through a pentecostal outpost from Azusa in
Norway. Boddy and his wife Mary began to speak in tongues and he preached
the doctrine of the Baptism with the Holy Spirit. Mary laid hands on
a young Smith Wigglesworth.

Pentecostal churches have two doctrines which have traditionally set them apart from older
denominations:

* their adventist theology, which is pre-millennial; 
* their belief of the Baptism in the Spirit, as a second distinct
Christian initiatory event, evidenced by speaking in tongues.

### Growing Pentecostal influence after WWII:

David Du Plessis, Pentecostals became involved in the World Council of
Churches, and even an observer at Vatican II, their influence
spread among younger evangelicals in other
denominations, including the Church of England.

Vatican II, whilst debating the Church, a draft text was submitted which suggested that the
Charismata belonged to the era of the Early Church, but — following
an intervention by Cardinal Joseph Suenens — a hard cessationist position
was avoided, and the acknowledgement of present charismata was included
in _Lumen Gentium_, the Council’s constitition on the Church:

> It is not only through the sacraments and the ministries of the Church that the Holy Spirit sanctifies
and leads the people of God and enriches it with virtues, but, "allotting his gifts to everyone
according as He wills, He distributes special graces among the faithful of every rank. By these gifts
He makes them fit and ready to undertake the various tasks and offices which contribute toward
the renewal and building up of the Church, according to the words of the Apostle: "The
manifestation of the Spirit is given to everyone for profit". These charisms, whether they be the
more outstanding or the more simple and widely diffused, are to be received with thanksgiving and
consolation for they are perfectly suited to and useful for the needs of the Church. Extraordinary
gifts are not to be sought after, nor are the fruits of apostolic labor to be presumptuously expected
from their use; but judgment as to their genuine nature and proper use belongs to those who are
appointed leaders in the Church, to whose special competence it belongs, not indeed to extinguish
the Spirit, but to test all things and hold fast to that which is good. 
-- Lumen Gentium 12.2

Effectively a re-adoption of charismata by the Roman Catholic church
for our times.

The Charismatic movement in Roman Catholicism can be traced back
to Catholic Professors reading The Cross and the Switchblade,
by Nicky Cruz, in 1967, which speaks of a Pentecostal Baptism with
the Spirit.

Anglican Charismatic renewal also began in America. In 1960, Dennis Bennett, a priest in the parish
of St Mark’s, Van Nuys in California received the baptism with the Spirit and spoke in tongues.

Van Nuys experience led to visits from some young priest from the Church of England. Michael
Harper, John Stott’s curate, received Baptism with the Spirit in 1965. Harper went on to found the
Fountain Trust which, for the following 15 years, formed the organisational basis for the spread of
Charismatic Renewal in the Church of England. Among those affected were:

* Colin Urquhart (St Hugh’s, Lewsey, Luton)
* John Collins (Holy Trinity Brompton)
* David Watson (St Michael le Belfry, York)
* David Pytches (St Andrew’s Chorleywood)

Other denominations experienced the charismata but it did not become
semi-institutionalised as in the CofE. 

In the early 1980s, John Wimber, former Quaker, visits with team from the Vineyard, in 
Anaheim, California.
Wimber rejected dispensationalism (a hallmark of ‘classic’ Pentecostals) and embraced a much
more radical approach to allowing the Holy Spirit to work charismatically in worship services
during times set aside for this to happen, so called ‘ministry times’. During the ministry times,
significant actions of the Spirit were claimed to happen by way of healings, words of prophecy,
words of knowledge as well as the more classic expression of the gift of tongues.

This brought a new focus on the miraculous, or ‘signs and wonders’ as a
normal aspect of Church life. Following fifteen years: ‘signs and wonders’
became a regular feature with visits from ‘the
Kansas City prophets’, and later, ‘the Toronto Blessing’ in which many
people were overwhelmed with laughter and made other raucous noises.

Alpha Course: Holy Trinity Brompton — was all about bringing people to
faith and included a ‘Holy Spirit’ weekend, where the opportunity would
be given for people to experience the gifts of the Spirit for themselves.
This recombining of charismata to evangelism helped rebalance the
direction of Charismatic renewal in Britain thereafter.

## Vatican II

Position after Reformation was that of the Council of Trent (1545-1563).
19^th^ century: things took a backward step: reaction to revolution and
emergent triumphalism. The
failure and condemnation of “Catholic modernism”.

In the early 20^th^ century: influence of WWI, socialism and ecumenism.
Key influence of the Liturgical Movement - called for a return to
primitive simplicity in the liturgy and an active
participation by all the laity. The Popes gave it some support and it
inspired both priestly and monastic vocations and inspired spiritual
regeneration at parish level. (Services were still all held in Latin.)

Pope John XXIII (Angelo Guiseppe Roncalli) — elected 1958, died 1963. 
Called Second Vatican Council.

Sat from 11 October 1962 until 8 December 1965. Key areas of change included:

* anew constitution on the liturgy and worship in vernacular languages;
* the acceptance of non-catholic (protestant) churches as “separated brethren”
* Roman Catholic Church as an observer, but not a full participant,
in the World Council of Churches (the Orthodox Churches are full members);
* the promotion of the Bible through new translations and commentaries
and the encouraging of ecumenical Christian scholarship;
* the re-recognition of the orthodoxy of the Eastern Churches and the
opening up of links after centuries with those churches;
* the reform of the understanding of the Catholic Church of the religious status of Jews.

In the wake of the Council, ecumenical discussions opened up between the
Catholics and Anglicans

* Archbishop of Canterbury visited Rome in the 1960s
* Pope John-Paul II made the first ever papal visit to the UK in 1982
* The Anglican/Roman Catholic International Commission (ARCIC)
* In the 1980s, discussions took place between the Roman Catholic Church
and the Baptist World Alliance, and these only stalled because of
opposition from the Baptist side. A
second series of talks took place between 2006 and 2010.

1968 Humanae Vitae reaffirmed the traditional church rejection of
artificial means of birth control.
Sex is primarily for procreation. This also explains the rejection of
homosexuality as intrinsically unnatural. Human Vitae was deeply
challenged, not only by gay liberation, but also by the AIDS
crisis in Africa, where heterosexual infection was aggravated by the
condemnation of condom use by the Catholic bishops there.

## Women

In the NT there were many women in positions of leadership and influence
in the Church, but from the second century onwards, their role was reduced
with increasing formalisation of the authority
structures of the church. Women’s influence in early Montanism.

Junia translated into Junius, a male form, though no evidence for Junius
as a Greek name and plenty for Junia.

Strong anti-women bias in 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ century took hold.

Women took significant roles in radical non-conformity: Quakers and
other fringe groups like the Shakers in America. Joanna Southcott
(1750-1814) was a famous prophetess who claimed, at the
age of 64, to be pregnant with the Messiah.

Women in the Salvation Army: William Booth — ‘all my best men are woman’.
Women were allowed to hold officer’s rank in the SA from its outset.
Catherine Booth changed her husband’s mind on the appropriateness of
women teaching in the organisation, partly through the
evangelistic effectiveness of her addresses.

The place of women in society — biology and technology. Patriarchal
attitudes were undermined, to some extent, by the place of women in the
industrialised workforce. The law: women didn’t
legally have custody of their children until 1838.
The Married Women Property Act 1870 granted
married women the right to own property they had earned or inherited:
prior to that, a married woman’s property belonged to her husband.

As medical practice developed in the latter part of the 19^th^ century,
the experience and longevity of women improved significantly.
The move for women to get the vote: began in Australia at the end
of the 19^th^ century and moved to the UK in the 20^th^ century.
Women were at the forefront of moves
to take control of their fertility, with Marie Stopes (1880—1959) being a
public advocate of the taboo subject of contraception. The Church of
England formally opposed artificial birth control,
with the Lambeth Conference of 1908 and retained this position until
the Lambeth Conference of 1930 which lifted the condemnation.

Women made up a very significant proportion of the 19^th^ century
missionary movement. Single women began to work within the deprived
areas of British cities in the Church of England: the first
deaconess in the Church of England was Elizabeth Ferard, who was
admitted to the order by the Bishop of London in 1862.

In the twentieth century, gradually, women were accepted into the
ordained ministry of protestant churches. The first congregational
woman minister was Constance Coltman who was ordained in
1917. Edith Gates was ordained to the Baptist ministry in 1918.

In Anglicanism, the first woman to be ordained priest was Florence Li, who was ordained priest in
1944. In 1971, the province of Hong Kong and Macau was the first Anglican province to approve
the ordination of women to the priesthood.

* USA (1974), Canada (1975), New Zealand (1977), Kenya (1980), Ireland (1990).
The Church of England Synod passed enabling legislation in 1992 with the first ordinations in 1993.
The ordination of Bishops followed a similar pattern:
For Anglican woman bishop was in the USA (Barbara Harris) in 1989

The Church of England General Synod agreed in November 2014,
Libby Lane ordained as Bishop of Stockport in 2015.

Feminist theology is a distinct discipline and process from the opening
up of ordained ministry to women.
