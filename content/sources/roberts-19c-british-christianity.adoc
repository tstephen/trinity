## Background Factors/Events

1. The French Revolution (1789)
   * An up-ending of tthe status quo that had been in place since medieval times.
   * By contrast, Britain had already had its revolution.
   * Church and status quo had been very closely linked thus Revolution almost destroyed the church (and it was illegal for a time)
   * Initiated on the back of growing disparity between rich and poor and by Descartes, then Voltaire, Russeau whose rational humanism was able to undermine the status quo
   * Within the revolution a period when no one was in charge and everything was violently turned on its head
   * In Britain, church and aristocracy very threatened and caused them to challenge the rational, enlightenment under-pinnings of revolution.
2. Romanticism: See works of Thomas Carlyle, Walter Scott and,
   in time, through the art of the Pre-raphaelites.
   * A reaction to the revolution and enlightenment with its totalitarian inclinations;
   maybe the past was not so bad and a more faviourable re-writing.
   * Does human reason produce beauty and joy? No, quite the opposite:
   ugliness, poverty and squalor.
   * A reactionary seeking after spirituality influenced theology
3. The Industrial Revolution:
   * grew out of the scientific method (a philosophy at the start) a century earlier
   * productivity of machines allowed some to become astonishingly wealthy in a short period of time.
   * these new men often not the traditional rules but non-conformists of _relatively_ small means
   * Biggest movement of population in Britain's history before or sense

This was taking place in the 18^th^ century alongside Methodism and the Evangelical Revival.

## Religion and Politics: the age of Reform and Social Transformation

- 1828: Repeal of the Corporation Act (1661) and
- 1829: Repeal of Test Act (1673) led to non-conformists and Roman Catholics entering public life.

May be seen as early steps towards pluralism, hence resisted by many churchmen, because
could (and would) lead to a Parliament ruling in ways that conflicted with the church.

Abolition of the Slave Trade - 80% of national income. William Wilberforce
led to abolition of Slave Trade (1807) and in 1833 it became illegal to have a slave.

Slave Trade debate caused abolistionists to go beyond the word of scripture which talks
of slave owning.

### Tithes

Snice medieval times the Church had the right to levy a 10% tithe on all
agricultural produce. Source of local income to the incumbent: varied
from parish to parish. Wealthy livings meant incumbents could
appoint a team of curates to do the work for them.

- 1837 change in the law permitted a standing payment in lieu of tithe
- Patronage (gift of the living of a parish) in many cases remained with the land-owners

Expansion of the cities: led to need for new parishes and new church buildings. For example the whole of South Manchester held just 3 parishers.

Waterloo churches: parliament-funded church building in 1818 and 1824. For example, https://www.stgeorgesbristol.co.uk/[St George's Brandon Hill], now a concert hall.

Church-building continued apace throughout the century.

## Tractarianism and Anglo-catholicism

### Early History: the Oxford Movement

Beginning dated to John Keble preaching his assize sermon at
Oxford University in 1833 called, _A National Apostasy_.

From the start, Anglo-Catholicism has been about the spiritual authority
and vocation of the Church of God, especially as applied to the Anglican Church.
For example, took exception at Whig government's abolution through Parliament of 10 bishoprics (in Ireland where population had left as they were Catholic).

Keble's contention was that the church was acting as no more than a minor part of the bureacracy entirely forgetting their calling.

Early Tractarians/Oxford Movement included:
- John Henry Newman
- Edward Bouvarie Pusey
- Frederick William Faber
Emphasising the continuity of the catholic identity of the Church of England:
The CofE had never eschewed it in the Reformation, particularly evidenced by continued three-fold order of bishops, priests and deacons.

This ‘reforming’ ecclesiology was contained in a series of 90
‘Tracts for the Times’, published in Oxford and widely-read.
The Oxford Movement leaders became known as ‘Tractarians’.

For the leaders of the Oxford Movement, a new stress on Catholicity
was the only antidote to Erastianism, spiritual bankrupcy and
the erosive effects of post-enlightenment liberalism.

Things came to a head when John Henry Newman published ‘Tract 90’ in 1840,
which argued that the doctrine of the Church of England, enshrined in
the Book of Common Prayer and the 39 Articles, was essentially the same
as that of the Roman Catholic Church therefore no need, with religious
liberalisation, for 'the Italian Mission' to seek to restore the Roman church in England.

The Bishop of Oxford forbade any further tracts and Newman felt it necessary to
resign from the university and lived as a parish priest before being welcomed
into the Rman Catholic church in 1845.

Gorham was a hard Calvinist who the Bishop of Exeter refused to institute over the
question of whether baptised infants were regenerate.

In the wake of the Gorham Controversy (1850), where a state court (the Privy Council) had overturned a judgement
by the bishops and the ecclesiastical courts over the nature of the
Church of England’s doctrine.

Those who left included Henry Manning (who became the first Cardinal Archbishop of
Westminster) and F.W. Faber.

At this stage little difference between Tractarians, Evangelicals and Low churchmen, except perhaps a slightly greater celebration of saints days. All followed the BCP.

### Anglo-Catholicism and the Ritualist Controversy

The second phase of the movement, a new generation of younger clergy came through who
sought to see holiness worked out through more ornate and beautiful worship, including a
heightened sense of ceremonial. Many had half an eye on the practices of the
Roman Catholic Church, wanting to emulate the ceremonial, whilst using the
text of the BCP. They introduced things like:

* Candles on the table
* Eastward facing presidency
* Singing of the liturgy (outside cathedrals this was rare)

As a result viewed with suspicion and tended to end up in poorly-endowed livings

* Processions
* Reservation of the Blessed Sacrament
* Incense
* Roman Vestments (cottas, albs, stoles, chasubles, birettas)
* Unleavened bread in communion
* Making the sign of the cross

This was reported in the press, and a number of riots and disruptions
occurred, engineered by anti-Catholic agitators such as the Kenset brothers.

More than a grain of truth in the suspicion that Anglo-catholics were trying to undo the Reformation.

No one entitled to deviate from the BCP, so _Evangelicals began to organise prosecutions of ritualist priests through the courts_.
The priests did not believe the secular courts possessed any spiritual
authority in such matters, so as they were
often successfully prosecuted, they regarded this as martyrdom.

So extremism on both sides fed off one another.

Godliness and self-sacrifice of the ‘slum-priests’: between 1876-1880,
three urban priests were prosecuted and imprisoned for ritualistic practices.

Example of Father McConnecky in east London who earned respect of the locals
for his care during a cholera epidemic.

As the 19^th^ century moved into the 20^th^, there was a growing distaste
by the wider church for persecuting people who ritually departed from
the BCP (although many Evangelicals continued to persecute with zeal).
Anglo-Catholicism was an increasingly powerful spiritual influence, whereas
Evangelicalism was steadily declining.

As a result, the Church of England in the 20^th^ century generally has
felt disinclined to use Canon Law (or the law of the land) to hound
those who liturgically deviate from the ‘legal’ line of the
Church of England on liturgy - especially when such liturgical
creativity is coupled with spiritual growth and dynamism.

So, the Anglo-Catholic *ritualists* were the pioneers of liturgical
*freedom* (and anarchy) in the Church of England! To the benefit of the charismatics
in the late 20th and 21st century.

Other parallel movements for high church practice in different parts of the world.

## Missionary Work

Colonialism opened way for missionary expansion, particularly successful in Africa.
The call to become a missionary was a major influence, particularly amongst evangelicals.

There is a case for the export of the cream of evangelical talent led to the decline
of the evangelical party in Britain.

The export of denominationalism. (See reading project.) This led in turn to
ecumenical efforts in response to the wastefulness of such competition.

Trinity College founded by coming together of Tyndale, and others, Tyndale was college for BCMS in response to concern that CMS was becoming too liberal.

## Science vs Religion

Early skirmishes: Galileo (1633)

Bishop James Ussher in 1648 dated the Creation to 4004BC.

Geology: dating of rocks led to different (much longer) chronology and also
testing of the 6-day hypothesis.

Charles Darwin: (1809-1882) Theory of evolution developed between late 1830s and the
publication of The Origin of Species (1859). The 1860s became a period of heated debate.
T.H. Huxley first to be explicit about link between humanity and apes -
founder of “agnosticism” as a religious position, based on the absence of evidence.
The Oxford Debate between Huxley and Bishop Samuel Wilberforce, Bishop of Oxford.

Three possible positions on science and religion emerged:
* Biblical literalism (believe the Bible and everything else needs to be adjusted);
* Integrate the Bible into the emerging scientific picture (with varying degrees of success);
* Abandon the Bible as a scientific source, retaining it for theology and ethics

This last was seen as a betrayal by certain parts of the church towards other parts.

This came to a head with the publication, in 1860, of the book Essays and Reviews,
which caused a storm over its approach to the Bible and Biblical authority and
led to a trial for heresy (highly unusual for those days!)

## The Second Coming

Conferences on biblical prophecy: Albury (1826-1830) and Powerscourt (1831-1833).
Focus on Daniel and Revelation, in particular. Believed to predict the, as yet, unfulfilled future.

Albury led to Catholic Apostolic church.

Powerscourt was attended by J.N. Darby (1800-1882), initially an Anglican minister,
then founder of the Plymouth Brethren. He developed a form of pre-millennialism
called dispensationalism.

Also invented the idea of the rapture - living Christians will meet Christ in
the sky before a period of terrible tribulation for the world. After destruction
of the Beast of Revelation, they will return
with Christ to reign for 1000 years. Then will come the raising of the dead,
the last judgement and heaven and hell for all eternity. This scheme was
implemented in the Schofield Chain-Reference Bible, published in America
and extensively bought. Dispensationalism then spread beyond
Plymouth Brethren thoughout America and, back, to the UK in the 20^th^ century.
