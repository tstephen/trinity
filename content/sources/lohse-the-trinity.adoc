## Chapter 2--The Doctrine of the Trinity

IN THE PRECEDING chapter the rule of faith and the
creed were presented as a criterion for the church’s preaching
and teaching. Both of these, the rule of faith and the creed,
constitute an important step in the direction of the development
of the church’s doctrine of the Trinity, because they summarize
briefly the faith of Christianity. It was still a long time, of
course, well into the fourth century, before the doctrine of the
Trinity was dogmatically clarified. How did this come about?
What were the reasons which moved the church to express its
faith in God and in Jesus Christ, as well as its experience of
the presence of the Holy Spirit, in the form of the doctrine of
the Trinity? Is it essential for one who wants to be a Christian
to accept this doctrine also?

First, it is important to note that the doctrine of the Trinity
does not go back to non-Christian sources, as has sometimes
been supposed in the past. There has been no lack of attempts
to find the initial form of the doctrine of the Trinity in Plato,
or in Hinduism, or in Parsiism. All such attempts may be regarded
today as having floundered. It is another question, of
course, whether or not the church, in developing the doctrine of
the Trinity, had recourse to certain thought forms already
present in the philosophical and religious environment, in order
that, with the help of these, it might give its own faith clear
intellectual expression. This question must definitely be
answered in the affirmative. In particular cases the appropriation
of this concept or that can often be proved. Unfortunately,
however, it is true that particularly in reference to the
beginnings of the doctrine of the Trinity there is still much
uncertainty. In this area final clarity has not yet been achieved.

As far as the New Testament is concerned, one does not find
in it an actual doctrine of the Trinity. This does not mean very
much, however, for generally speaking the New Testament is
less intent upon setting forth certain doctrines than it is upon
proclaiming the kingdom of God, a kingdom that dawns in and
with the person of Jesus Christ. At the same time, however,
there are in the New Testament the rudiments of a concept of
God that was susceptible of further development and
clarification, along doctrinal lines.

Judaism, which constituted the environment in which the
early Christians lived and from which they themselves had
come, has always been an austerely monotheistic religion. From
it Christianity inherited monotheism. Over against pagan
polytheism Christians and Jews have always had monotheism in
common, though their understanding of it differs.

From the very beginning, of course, Christians not only
believed in God in the sense in which the Jews did, but they
also believed in Jesus Christ. The Holy Spirit, too, was
mentioned more frequently by them, and in a different way.
Speaking first of the person of Jesus Christ, it should be observed
that Christians expressed their faith in him in a great variety
of ways. For the primitive church Jesus Christ was the Messiah.
As the Gospel of John emphasizes again and again, his
early followers regarded him as standing in an incomparably
close and indissoluble union with the Father. In other places
he is called the likeness of God (2 Cor. 4:4; Col. 1:15). In the
prologue of the Gospel of John we are told that the divine
Logos, who was in the beginning with God, became flesh in
Jesus Christ (John 1:1-18). Here the pre-existence of Christ
before his earthly life is asserted. In doing so it was possible
for the church to begin with certain conceptions which
pre-Christian Judaism had formed about the pre-existence of the
figure of Wisdom, But what had been only an ideal within
Judaism was regarded within Christianity from the standpoint of
the decisive fact of the incarnation.

Other passages, too, speak of the pre-existence of Christ, or
at least presuppose it (e.g., Phil. 2:5-11; Rom. 8:32; 2 Cor. 8:9).
A number of passages go so far as to call Christ God. It is
disputed, of course, whether in Romans 9:5, for example, the word
"God" actually has reference to Christ, or whether the last
words in this verse represent a benediction which speaks of
God the Father. Most of the objections which are raised against
the conception that Paul here calls Christ God are based only
on the general consideration that the strict monotheism which
Paul inherited from Judaism would keep him from making such
an assertion. In reply to these objections it may be said that
Paul was able to pray to the exalted Lord. It would follow,
therefore, that he could also use the word "God" for Christ. In
other passages of the New Testament the predicate "God" is
without a doubt applied to Christ.
footnote:[At John 1:18 the best manuscripts read, "the only (or, only begotten)
God" (monogenés theos). Cf. 1 John 5:20, "This is the true God and eternal
life."]
With these affirmations,
which for Jewish monotheism were utterly offensive, Christians
expressed their faith that it was not merely some heavenly
being which encountered them in Jesus Christ, but God himself,
and that because of this, his coming, especially his cross and
his resurrection, had meaning for the entire world.

The New Testament affirmations about the Holy Spirit are
not so clear and univocal as those about Jesus Christ. It was
known that the Spirit had spoken through the prophets and that
he had descended at the baptism of Jesus in order to equip
him for his work. The Johannine affirmations about the Spirit
are especially far-reaching. For the period after his departure
Jesus promises his people the Paraclete (nes, "Advocate"; Rsv,
"Counselor"), who is purposely called "the Spirit of truth"
(John 14:17), or "the Holy Spirit" (John 14:26). Since it is
asserted of the Spirit that he is "another Paraclete" (John 14:16),
it could be supposed that the Spirit is here conceived to be
another person distinct from Jesus Christ. But this is hardly the
case. The meaning, rather, is that in the Spirit Jesus himself
comes to his disciples as the Paraclete. It is noteworthy, of
course, and very important for the development of dogma, that
Christ and the Paraclete are not simply equated, but that the
Spirit is called "another Paraclete." How vividly the early
church experienced the reality of the Spirit, and how definitely
it was influenced by that reality, can be seen on every hand in
the Pauline letters. The Spirit is called the Spirit of God, as
well as the Spirit of Christ (Rom. 8:9). Here, too, however,
the Spirit is not yet conceived in personal terms, at least not
in the sense of the later doctrine of the Trinity.

The New Testament is not satisfied, however, with these
sometimes rather far-reaching assertions about God the Father,
Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit. Some passages present triadic
formulas. They are called "triadic," and not "trinitarian,"
because they name Father, Son, and Spirit alongside one another
without reflecting upon the oneness of God and, hence, do not
yet contain a doctrine of the Trinity. We have such a formula
in 2 Corinthians 13:13, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ
and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be
with you all." It is significant that while in Ephesians 4:4-6 the
Spirit, the Son, and the Father are all mentioned and without
further elucidation, in each case the "one" is emphasized. There
is "one God," not three gods, in whom Christians believe. The
baptismal command in Matthew 28:19 is especially striking in
this respect: baptism is to take place "in the name of the Father
and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." The significant thing
about this formula is not so much that here Father, Son, and
Spirit are named alongside one another, which happened
frequently at the time, but that mention is made of the "name" of
the Holy Spirit. There are not three names in reference to
which baptism is to take place, but one name, a name,
moreover, which includes the name of the Holy Spirit. The
understanding of the Spirit upon which this baptismal formula is
based goes much further than that which is otherwise found
in the Gospel of Matthew. As a matter of fact the church
possessed in this baptismal command an affirmation which went
far beyond its comprehension at the time, and the full content
and deep significance of which it could appreciate only after a
long development had come to fruition. The reason was that
the church had hardly begun to realize what the confession of
Jesus Christ as God, as well as the presence of the divine Spirit
in the church, would mean for its total understanding of God.
At the same time it can hardly be doubted that the affirmations
of faith which the first Christians made with reference to God
the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and which were based upon
God’s act in Jesus Christ and upon the pouring out of the Holy
Spirit, simply cried out for fuller elaboration. It was not merely
a necessity to point out, in opposition to Judaism, in what sense
a Christian is a monotheist. The faith itself demanded greater
clarity.

It is not surprising in the least to find that the church
fumbled for some time in its attempt to formulate intellectually
and conceptually its faith in God the Father, Jesus Christ, and
the Holy Spirit. Nor is it surprising that occasionally it took
the wrong road, and then found it necessary to retrace its steps
and begin looking for the right road again. At times it even
seemed as if the task it had set for itself could not be mastered.
From the beginning, of course, certain fundamentals were
firmly held by the church, namely, that God is one, i.e., that it
did not believe in two, let alone three gods; that this one God
has revealed himself in a threefold way as Father, Son, and
Holy Spirit; that Father and Son may not be equated in a way
which dissolves the differences between them, as if the Son
were merely a "mask" behind which the Father hides himself.
But how were these fundamental articles of faith to be comprehended
in a formula? In what concepts could they be appropriately expressed?

When in the second century the church’s center of gravity,
as well as that of its theology, shifted definitely from the
Palestinian realm to the world of Greek thought, the church faced
the necessity of expressing its faith in a form that would be
intelligible to the Greek mind. The result was that metaphysical
concepts which were focused upon being took the place of concrete,
biblical forms of speech. As we know, Greek thought
differs from biblical thought above all in this, that for the
latter the truth of God is revealed in history, while for the former
it is grounded in metaphysical being. When related to the concept
of God, this meant that the difference between God the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit could be understood as
one of metaphysical self-subsistence (hypostasis). The apologists
of the ancient church pioneered in this respect when they
united the Greek concept of Logos with the Logos idea of John,
chap. 1. Of course, the attempt of a man such as the apologist
Justin Martyr to designate Christ "another God" created its own
set of problems.
footnote:[Justin Martyr, Dialogue with Trypho, chap. 56. ANF 1, 223 ff.]

Against such pluralism stood what was called Monarchianism.
Its main concern was to preserve monotheism within Christianity.
The basic point at issue was the relation of the Father
and the Son to each other. Christology and the doctrine of the
Trinity have always been intimately connected, but this was
especially true at the beginning. The Monarchians were of the
opinion that the problem could be solved by thinking of the
divinity of the Son as being merely derived, or by seeing in
the Son only a mode of appearance of the Father. According
to one brand of Monarchianism, so-called dynamistic Monarchianism,
an impersonal divine power was active in the man
Jesus. Thereafter Christ was adopted as the Son of God. This
dynamistic Monarchianism in its pure form was found especially
toward the end of the second century and occasionally
still in the third. There is a naive, adoptionistic concept which
is much older, however, and is embodied in many writings of
the ancient church which are otherwise thoroughly orthodox.

A second brand of Monarchianism, so-called modalistic
Monarchianism, already represents a more developed concept. It,
too, was represented among various segments of the church
around the year 200. The modalistic Monarchians argued that
God is only a single person. The Son and the Spirit merely
represent modes of appearance of the one God. Sabellius, who
was active in Rome at the beginning of the third century, even
used the expression "Son-Father."

It doubtlessly was the concern of Monarchianism, and justifiably
so, to insist upon the unity of God. In all ages the danger
that in the development of its faith the church might fall
prey to polytheism has probably been greater than the danger
that the differences between the persons of the Trinity might
be leveled. It is deceptive, however, to think that Monarchianism
was in a better position to hold to the unity of God than
was the church. For either it was forced to see in Christ, after
his baptism or after his resurrection, a kind of half-God, as was
the case with dynamistic Monarchianism; or else, in the attempt
to do away with the differences between Father and Son, it
became necessary to disregard entirely the Gospel accounts
which show the earthly Jesus praying to God the Father. This
is what happened in modalistic Monarchianism. Both forms of
this movement, therefore, abandoned something which, for the
church, was absolutely fundamental.

Beyond this, the many gnostic systems which were developed
in the second century also exerted an influence upon the formation
of the church’s doctrine of the Trinity. It is true that the
Gnostics did not develop their own doctrine of the Trinity.
What they did, rather, was to include God the Father, God the
Son, and the Holy Spirit among their many aeons. The Gnostic,
Valentinus, professed knowledge of no less than thirty
aeons, below all of which he ranked Christ. According to most
gnostic systems, Christ had only a phantom body on earth,
which he abandoned again before the crucifixion. Therefore it
was not Christ, the Son of God, who died, but only the man
Jesus. This Christology is called docetism. Over against such
systems, the church could not be satisfied with the mere
repetition of the baptismal command of Matthew 28:19, or with other
New Testament affirmations. It had to develop its faith further.

### Early Traces of a Doctrine of the Trinity

A saying of Justin Martyr indicates what lack of clarity there
was with regard to the development of the doctrine of the
Trinity as late as the middle of the second century. In his
Apology Justin seeks to weaken the pagan reproach that Christians
are atheists. He admits that Christians indeed reject the
false pagan gods, but, he goes on to say, they do not deny the
true God, who is the Father of justice and chastity and of all
the other virtues, and who will have nothing to do with that
which is evil. He then says, "Both him and the son who came
forth from him and taught us these things, and the host of
other good angels who follow and are made like to Him, and
the prophetic Spirit, we worship and adore, because we honor
[him] in reason and truth."
footnote:[Justin Martyr, The First Apology, chap. 6. [The rendering in ANF 1,
164, does not imply angel worship. In translating we have reproduced the
author’s literal rendering of the passage.—TRANSLATOR.\]]
As if it were not enough that in this enumeration angels
are mentioned as beings which are honored
and worshiped by Christians, Justin does not hesitate to
mention angels before naming the Holy Spirit. The sequence in
which the beings that are worshiped are mentioned (God the
Father, Christ, the angels, the Spirit) is noteworthy. Yet we
would be doing Justin an injustice if we were to put him on
the same plane as the Gnostics such as Valentinus.

Only toward the end of the second century was greater
clarity introduced into the doctrine of God. Of importance here
was, first of all, Irenaeus, Bishop of Lyons. In his doctrine of
God two basic features are evident. First, he spoke of God’s
inner being, and, second, of his progressive self-disclosure in the
history of salvation [Heilsgeschichte]. Sometimes Irenaeus
emphasizes the unity of God so strongly that he does not shrink
from using expressions which sound modalistic, as if Son and
Spirit were only appearances of the one God. In his Proof of
the Apostolic Preaching he says, "Thus God is shown to be one
according to the essence of His being and power" even though
"as the administrator of the economy of our redemption, He is
both Father and Son. .. ."
footnote:[Irenaeus, Proof of the Apostolic Preaching, chap. 47. ACW 16,78.]
In this way Irenaeus hoped to avoid
every pluralistic expression with reference to God. He knew, of
course, how to differentiate between God the Father, Son, and
Holy Spirit. Irenaeus was of the same opinion as the apologists
of the ancient church, especially Theophilus of Antioch, when
he taught that God had with him from all eternity his Word
and his Wisdom. These were, so to speak, hypostases. God
brought them forth from himself before the creation of the
world. The Son was begotten of the Father before time. To
every further speculation, which tries to enter into the mystery
of the begetting of the Son, Irenaeus objects.

In this way Irenaeus developed the basic features of a doctrine
of the Trinity. It is, in fact, the most fully developed doctrine
of the Trinity during the first and second centuries. Its
characteristic feature is that it does not begin with three co-eternal
persons, as does the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity in the
fourth century, but with the person of the Father who has with
and beside himself his Word and his Wisdom. To employ the
terminology of a later period, it is not possible to speak of
three co-eternal persons in Irenaeus’ doctrine of God. Nor
should it be expected that the rank of the Son or that of the
Spirit would be clearly expressed. The development of the
doctrine of the divine persons took place in Irenaeus only from the
point of view of the history of salvation.

Tertullian, who lived in Carthage and was the first theologian
of the church to write in Latin, expressed himself similarly on
the doctrine of God. He, too, began with the person of God
the Father, who has with him Word and Spirit, and who brings
these forth out of himself for the purpose of the creation of
the world. Yet Tertullian’s work proved to be of great
significance for the later development of the doctrine of the Trinity,
thanks to his coining of precise formulas giving expression to
the unity of God as well as to the threeness of the persons. It
was his intention to hold to the one substance in three related
persons.
footnote:[Tertullian, Against Praxeas, chap. 12. ANF 3, 607.]
Three persons exist, he said, in the one substance, and
still there is only one God. For the history of salvation,
however, there is a threefold differentiation of the unity. God's
_oikonomia_, his _Heilsgeschichte_, requires three persons. In a
statement formulated with acute precision Tertullian says that
they are differentiated _non statu sed gradu, nec substantia sed
forma, nec potestate sed specie_ ("not in condition, but in
degree; not in substance, but in form; not in power, but in aspect").
footnote:[Ibid., chap. 2. ANF 3, 598.]
The three are thus one, though not one person. Tertullian thus
pithily summed up older thinking concerning the
doctrine of God and he rejected, at the same time, the heresies
of Monarchianism and Gnosticism. Thus the basic elements of
the doctrine of the identity of substance with reference to
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are already present in Tertullian,
even though, on the other hand, he strictly subordinates the Son
to the Father and at times uses rather unfortunate images, such
as his likening of Father, Son, and Spirit to root, branch, and
fruit.

Origen (d. 254) went much further than Irenaeus and Tertullian.
This acute thinker, who had already engaged in textual
criticism of the biblical writings and from whose pen we have
the first Christian dogmatics, also made an important
contribution to the doctrine of God. This is true even though it must
be admitted that his doctrine of the Trinity contains many
problems which helped to bring about the beginning of the Arian
controversy.

Origen’s doctrine of the Trinity is marked by two basic features.
First, like Irenaeus and Tertullian, he puts great emphasis on
the unity of God. Yet he does not set it forth very
clearly. The reason is that in addition to his emphasis on the
unity of God he lays stress upon the differences between the
persons. In doing so he goes beyond his predecessors. Strictly
speaking, only the Father is God, though the name "God" may
also be applied to the Son and to the Holy Spirit. The divinity
of the Son and of the Spirit is derived from the Father. God
brings forth the Son in an eternal act. As the Son is subordinated
to the Father, even so the Spirit is subordinated to the
Son. For the three persons of the Godhead, Origen uses the
concept of hypostasis, by which he means an individual essence,
or individual subsistence. Thus Son and Spirit are other than
the Father with regard to their hypostasis. At the same time,
however, he holds that all three persons are one in the sense
that they possess a unity and harmony of will. For this kind of
unity Origen already used the concept of homoousios ("oneness of
being," or in the common liturgical rendering, "of one
substance"), which later was given dogmatic status at Nicaea
(325), even though he held to the numerical difference between
Father and Son. There can be no doubt, however, that although
Origen always held to the unity of the three persons, and was
thus the first to develop an actual doctrine of the Trinity, he
was not so successful in making clear the unity of the three
divine persons as he was in defining their differences. Here the
tensions in his doctrine of God become evident. It was possible,
for instance, for Origen to say that the Son was a creature of
the Father, thus strictly subordinating the Son to the
Father, while at the same time he insisted upon a unity of
substance with regard to Father and Son. The problematical nature
of his doctrine of the Trinity is especially evident in the fact
that, contrary to both the New Testament and tradition, Origen
rejected prayer to the exalted Lord. Only prayer to God the
Father is permitted, he insisted, although such prayer has to be
made through the Son and the Spirit.’

Of no less importance is the second feature of Origen’s doctrine
of God. He was of the opinion that, since God the Father
is perfect in goodness and power, he must always have had
objects toward which he exercised this goodness and power. On
the basis of this presupposition Origen taught the doctrine,
reminiscent of certain gnostic systems, that before the creation
of the cosmos God called into being a world of spiritual beings
which are co-eternal with him. The world of history, he
asserted, God created only when these spiritual beings fell away
from him, Furthermore, said Origen, these eternal beings were
subordinated to God the Father from the beginning. Hence a
mediator between God’s absolute oneness and this multiplicity
of beings was necessary. This mediator is the Son. Origen’s
teaching concerning the eternal generation of the Son, ie, a
generation which is not yet a completed act, must be seen
against the background of this concept of an eternal creation.
It has thus an entirely different foundation from that of a
similar idea found in the later theology of the Trinity, for which
the eternal generation of the Son was founded upon the notion
that in eternity there is no past and no future but only an
eternal now (Augustine). It is immediately apparent that this
second feature of Origen’s doctrine of the Trinity is
considerably more problematical than the first. The assumption of an
eternal creation directly contradicted the church’s doctrine, as
well as the statements of Scripture. Through its controversy
with the various gnostic systems, the church had become fully
aware of the fact that the doctrine concerning an eternal
creation could not be brought into harmony with the Bible and the
Christian faith. As a result, Origen’s notion of the eternal
generation of the Son as well as his conception of the unity of the
Son with the Father had to stand or fall with his insistence
upon an eternal creation.

During the decades between the death of Origen and the beginning
of the Arian controversy, it became clear that the Origenistic
doctrine of the Trinity had to be refined in one way
or another. Most theologians rejected the eternity of creation.
This made it necessary, however, either to emphasize the strict
subordination of the Son to the Father, or to go beyond Origen
in strongly asserting the oneness in substance of the different
hypostases. All subsequent theology, however, whether it stands
to the "left" or to the "right" of Origen, owes to him that which
is really decisive. For only through him, and since his time,
has the task of actually developing a doctrine of the Trinity
which progresses beyond the older theologians’ "economic"
Trinity and toward an "immanent" Trinity been recognized, that
is to say, a doctrine of the Trinity which sees in the successive
revelation of the persons of the divine Trinity at the same time
a reference to God’s eternal being. Furthermore, as will be
pointed out below, only through Origen did the Logos Christology
gain universal acceptance. Thus all later generations have
learned from Origen, even when they did not share his onesided emphasis.

### Arius

Arius (d. 336), too, had learned some things from Origen.
The intellectual world out of which Arius came, the school of
Lucian of Antioch, took over much from Origen. But if it is
true anywhere, it is true here, that the same things said by
two different people are not the same. Arius, more than Lucian,
changed and restructured the Origenistic theology. In this endeavor
he permitted himself to be guided by certain distinct
motives which, in their Arian form, were not present in Origen.

Arius’ prime concern was to emphasize the uniqueness and
transcendence of God. This must be kept clearly in mind if we
are to avoid passing hasty judgments that would keep us from
understanding a man like Arius. A confession of faith by Arius
says, "We confess one God who alone is unbegotten, alone
eternal, alone without beginning, alone true, alone immortal,
alone wise, alone good, alone Lord, alone the judge of all." By
"God" Arius always means God the Father only. Because His
being is absolutely transcendent and absolutely immutable it
cannot be communicated to anyone else. Hence, everything that
exists besides this transcendent God must have been created, and
that means that it must have come out of nothing. Arius
resolutely rejects the thought that the Son came forth from the
Father. He felt that such thought-forms apply physical categories
to God. More than that, such a concept would make of
God a "composite," which is impossible.

What, then, does Arius say about Jesus Christ? It is true that
Arius, like the apologists Irenaeus and Tertullian before him,
held that God has with him from eternity his Word and his
Wisdom. But for Arius these two simply coincide with the being
of God and have nothing to do with the second and third
persons of the Trinity. The Word, on the other hand, which in
Jesus Christ became flesh, is a creature of God, created by him
out of nothing before the beginning of time. Not that Arius
puts the Son on the same plane with other creatures. According
to him the Son is a perfect creature, but he is not a creature
in the sense in which other creatures are. In referring to
the Son as a creature, says Arius, one should not speak of a
generation of the Son, since this would bring him too close to
the Father. Only in a derivative sense should the word "generation"
ever be used. Under no circumstances may any unity
of substance between Father and Son be asserted. This is for
Arius the worst heresy. What must be said instead is that God
was not always Father, but that there was a time when he was
alone and was not yet Father. Only later did he become Father.
Immutability may not be asserted of the Son as it can of the
Father. The Son may be called God, to be sure, but his divinity
is not an attribute of his being. It is something bestowed
upon him by God’s grace.

Arius, too, recognized the necessity of taking over the
Origenistic concept of hypostasis. He even talked, and seemingly
much like Origen, of three hypostases, ie., of the three persons
--the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Thus Arius also
assumed a supreme Triad, which means that he did not deny
or attempt to conceal the distinctiveness of the Son and of the
Holy Spirit as did Monarchianism. So Arius, too, was not able
to hold himself aloof from the general trend which the doctrine
of God had taken since the second century.

Yet even though one may appreciate the concern of Arius and
would like to give credence to some of his ideas, it is difficult
not to regard his outline of the doctrine of God as highly
dangerous. In the last analysis Arius ends up with many unresolved
problems, which are really much greater than those which he
had set out to solve. He wanted to hold on to the uniqueness
of God, and it seemed he had succeeded in doing so. In reality,
however, he made out of Christ a kind of demigod, who was
neither quite man nor quite God. A similar observation may be
made about his understanding of the Holy Spirit, although it
should be remembered, of course, that the doctrine of the Holy
Spirit was not yet debated in his day. While it was still
possible for Origen to unite in his thought the three hypostases
which he taught, in Arius they became three divinities
differentiated from one another in terms of gradations.
In Arius’ doctrine of God, therefore, that which had long been present in
theology as a latent danger, namely, the strict subordination of
the Son to the Father, was now openly expressed. At an earlier
period, as a result of the appropriation of certain ideas from
Jewish apocalyptic, a so-called angel Christology had actually
been developed in which Jesus Christ appeared as an especially
exalted angelic being. Prior to Arius this notion had been held
in rather naive form, since no one had yet thought it through
to the end. In Arius’ doctrine of God, however, which drew
upon philosophical concepts and ideas and was more fully
‘Aleveloped than earlier notions of a similar cast, the peril
of a subordinationist Christology appeared. The dangerous consequence
of the Arian doctrine is found in the assertion that Christ, since
he is not God, cannot truly know the Father. Hence not even
revelation can give a full knowledge of God. This inadequate
doctrine of God, therefore, leads necessarily to an entirely
inadequate doctrine of revelation.

If one desires to adhere to the uniqueness of God, as well as
to the validity of the revelation of God in Jesus Christ, the path
Arius took is certainly not the one to follow. It leads to a new
form of polytheism. It is praiseworthy that Arius did not seek
to preserve the unity of God at the cost of revelation. Yet to
follow the path he took means either that one must deny the
revelation of God in Jesus Christ or that one must assume there
is more than one God. One thing Arius did accomplish, however.
With an urgency that could not be ignored, he posed the
question for the church whether, according to its faith, Jesus
Christ is a creature standing on a level far beneath God or
whether he is God himself. This is the basic question in the
Arian controversy.

### The Council of Nicaea

Arius was pastor of the Church of St. Baucalis in Alexandria.
Alexandria had long been the center not only of intellectual life
in general, but also of theology. Here Origen, the most famous
Greek theologian of the ancient church, had long been active.
Thus the opinions of Arius, having been expressed in this city,
were bound to attract attention. At first it seemed that perhaps
no controversy would arise. Arius’ bishop, Alexander of Alexandria,
was a peace-loving man who, as far as he himself was concerned,
would have preferred to avoid an argument. But things
had progressed too far for that. Behind Arius stood many people
in all parts of the Greek East who shared his opinions.

When in the year 324 Constantine the Great, after his victory
over Licinius, had become ruler also of the eastern part of the
Roman Empire, he found the Eastern church embroiled in bitter
controversy. The first emperor to become a Christian, Constantine
had basically no understanding whatsoever of the questions that
were being asked in Greek theology. In the controversy over the
doctrine of the Trinity he saw nothing more than
unnecessary bickering of theologians, which might best be
avoided by eschewing all speculation and by living together in
love and harmony. At the same time Constantine was concerned
about keeping or restoring ecclesiastical peace. After all, the
church had an important service to perform in his empire. It
was to rid the people of the immoralities which had made broad
inroads among them and to guide men into law and order; it
was to be concerned about the extension of the pure worship
of God; and above all else, it was to ask and to obtain God’s
blessing for the emperor and his realm by discharging responsibly
its tasks as a church. The emperor therefore stepped into
the controversy and extended invitations for a great council to
be held at Nicaea (325), the imperial residence not far from
the sea of Marmara in Asia Minor.

In order to follow the course of the discussions at the Council
of Nicaea, it is necessary to keep in mind the entirely new
situation in which the church found itself at this point in its history.
After having been persecuted for three hundred years, with only
an occasional brief respite, the church was now confronted with
an emperor who professed the Christian faith. To add to the
novelty, Constantine’s conversion had come on the heels of the
Diocletian persecution, which had been the most ruthless the
ancient church had ever known. For the first time in its history
Christianity in the Roman Empire was no longer the persecuted
religion; now officially tolerated and recognized, in some
respects it was even fostered by the empire. From a purely
external point of view the change in the situation was evident to
the bishops in the fact that they no longer needed to move
about secretly nor did they have to use the normal means of
travel to visit one another. They now had the privilege of coming
to the council by means of transportation provided by the
state, ie., means which were intended for use by ranking state
officials. At Nicaea the emperor provided lodging for the bishops
in his palace. It was there, too, that the discussions took
place, and in the presence of the emperor at that. The changed
situation could not have been brought home more forcefully. It
is understandable if the bishops showed their gratitude by
generous efforts to oblige the emperor.

In the course of the long discussions which now took place
at Nicaea the empéror intervened personally several times. Even
though he had a general antipathy to the controversies, and
even though he himself had only a rudimentary "theology," he
was still not entirely without sympathy for the problems which
arose. In any case, he permitted himself to be more fully
instructed about many things by his episcopal counselors. The
decisive catchword of the Nicene confession, namely, homoousios
("of one substance"), comes from no less a person than the
emperor himself. To the present day no one has cleared up the
problem of where the emperor got the term. It seems likely that
it was suggested to him by his episcopal counselor, Bishop
Hosius (Ossius) of Cordova, and it was probably nothing more
than a Greek translation of a term already found in Tertullian,
who used it to express the idea that Father and Son are of one
substance.

‘At the council a solemn confession of faith was formulated,
which embodied the results of the discussions. The basis of it
was a confession which came from the area of Syria-Palestine,
and which probably stems from Jerusalem. This confession of
Nicaea must not be confused with the confession which in today’s
services of worship is often called the Nicene Creed. Actually
the latter should be referred to as the Niceno-Constanti
nopolitan Creed (381). The Nicene confession of 325 reads as
follows:

> ‘We believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker of all
things visible and invisible;

> ‘And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, begotten from
the Father, only-begotten, that is, from the substance of the
Father, God from God, light from light, true God from true God,
begotten not made, of one substance with the Father, through
Whom all things came into being, things in heaven and things
on earth, Who because of us men and because of our salvation
came down and became incarnate, becoming man, suffered and
rose again on the third day, ascended to the heavens, and will
come to judge the living and the dead;
And in the Holy Spirit.

Immediately upon this confession follow the anathemas upon
heretical opinions. They read as follows:

> But as for those who say, There was when He was not, and,
Before being born He was not, and that He came into existence
out of nothing, or who assert that the Son of God is of a different
hypostasis or substance, or is created, or is subject to alteration or
change—these the Catholic Church anathematizes.

Most of the bishops who were present at the council signed
this creed. Among the signers were those who, judging by their
theological presuppositions, could not do so, or could hardly do
so, such as Eusebius of Caesarea. What seemed especially
objectionable to many bishops and theologians of the East was the
concept put into the creed by Constantine himself, the homoousios,
which in the subsequent strife between orthodoxy and
heresy became the object of dissension. Even most of the Arians
put their names to the creed. Only Arius and two of his friends
refused to sign, for which they were excommunicated.

What was the exact meaning of this creed which had been
signed by theologians of such divergent opinions and which,
strangely enough, at first served as a formula of concord, only
to generate ever new controversy later? It is not easy to ascertain
the original meaning of the confession of Nicaea. The
reason for this difficulty is not to be found in the paucity of
sources, although it is true that the records of the individual
discussions at the council are no more available. The real reason
it is not so easy to establish the original meaning of the
Nicene decision lies in the fact that the church could not stop
with this decision, but was virtually forced to move toward further
clarifications of its doctrine of God. As a result the decision of
Nicaea was given a progressively new and deeper meaning. This
later interpretation of the Nicene confession is therefore not
necessarily inconsistent with its original meaning. Quite
to the contrary, this interpretation probably sets forth the import
of the Nicene decision more profoundly and better than did the
council fathers themselves. It becomes apparent here that the
history of doctrine is not concerned merely with the historical
origins of a series of doctrinal propositions, but with confessions
which constantly need to be adapted and interpreted.

This much is certain, of course, that the Nicene confession
was meant to reject the teaching of Arius, and did reject it.
With great emphasis the council insisted that the Son is not
created, but begotten. This concept of "begetting" is meant to
exclude the idea that the Son was called into being out of nothing,
as well as the idea that there was a time when God the
Father was alone, i.e., was not yet the Father. In this way the
immutability and eternity of God are attested. The rejection of
Arianism meant, however, that this immutability and eternity of
God is also asserted of the Logos, i.e., the second person of the
Trinity.

What, then, is the positive sense of the Nicene confession? In
order to ascertain this the affirmations that the Son is "from the
substance of the Father" and that he is "of one substance with
the Father" must be kept in mind. The first of these two
formulations certainly seems to say that the Logos is in a true sense
the Son of the Father, in other words, that we are dealing here
with a "metaphysical" sonship. This first formulation emphasizes,
then, that the Son has the same divine nature as the Father
from whom he came forth. Every other affirmation, which dispenses
with the concept of begetting, would necessarily lead to
the conclusion that the Son is not only a person other than the
Father, but that he is also "something other" than the Father,
ite., that he is not God.

To determine the sense of the expression "of one substance
with the Father" is more difficult. It is clear at the outset that
this formula cannot assert anything other than what is meant by
the expression "from the substance of the Father," and it is
undoubtedly not meant to say anything else. The question arises,
however, in what sense the unity of substance, which is emphasized,
is to be understood. Are Father and Son one in the sense
intended by Origen? That is, are they one as the result of the
identity of substance, while they are distinct numerically, as
Origen asserted during the controversy against the Monarchians?
Or is the formula to be understood identity of substance?

For a long time the decision of Nicaea was understood in th
second sense. We meet this interpretation already in the ancient
church. There was no question but that the concept "of one
substane with the Father" allows this interpretation, indeed.
even demands it. In that case, "of one substance with the
Father" means that the persons of the Godhead are one common
divine Being. While this interpretation accords with the
later orthodox understanding, it hardly expresses the original
meaning of this expression: the concept _homoousios_ was not
understood in this sense at the time. For the theologians of the
third century _homoousios_ simply meant "of the same substance."
There was as yet no reflection about the question of numerical
identity. It would be difficult to imagine that at the synod of
Nicaea the concept _homoousios_ could suddenly and without
preparation have been used in a new sense, "
It is probable that with its choice of the expression "of one
substance with the Father" the Council of Nicaea meant to
strengthen once more its "begotten, not made" and this the
divinity of the Son, The council did not attempt to solve the
question of the divine unity and the distinctness of the persons.
What it meant to do was to assert, against Arius and his theory,
which made a demigod out of Jesus Christ, the full divinity of
the Son. Yet, even if the decision of Nicaea is understood in
this sense, which is narrower than the customary
understanding of an earlier day, it is still of considerable
importance that the proposition that Jesus Christ is God
had long been held; we meet its beginnings already in the New
Testament. Yet the subordinationism latent in the church
which in the theology of Arius is raised to its highest point,
led to a limitation of this affirmation, This subordinationist
development was now warded off, and the full divinity of the Son was
set forth. It is clear that as a result new problems were created
a once. The two most important of these were, first, the relationships
of the various divine persons to each other, and, second
the relationship of the divinity of Jesus, as asserted at Nicaea,
to the image of Jesus as it appears in the Gospels. These two
problems were to absorb much of the church’s energy during
the following period.

No less important, however, is the significance of the Nicene
confession in another respect. In addition to the theological
errors it rejected, the confession also represents a denial of a
philosophical concept of God. It was clear that in arriving at
the christological propositions he was able to formulate so
acutely, Arius had permitted himself to be influenced by certain
philosophical presuppositions. Of course, the Christian church
cannot escape the necessity of expressing its faith in a language
that is clear and conceptually articulate. For that reason it has
never been able to dispense with the use of philosophical concepts.
It must be remembered, however, that the use of such
concepts in theology is not the same as in philosophy. Luther
once said that if philosophical concepts are to be used in theology
they must, so to speak, be taken "to the bath" i.e., they must
be baptized.
footnote:[Luther, Promotionsdisputation von Palladius und Tilemann (1537), WA 391, 229, Il. 16-19.]
At Nicaea, at any rate, the church did not
attempt to penetrate the mystery of God or to describe it as
did Arius, from the point of view of the philosophical concept
of transcendence. It is true that in return the church had to
accept the fact that its confession contains a paradox. Yet is
this not the paradox which consists in the Word’s being made flesh?

### More Than Five Decades of Controversy

The Council of Nicaea did not end the Arian controversy.
Indeed, it is with Nicaea that the controversy began in earnest
To be sure, most of the bishops who were present at Nicaea
signed the creed. But there were widespread differences among
the signers in the way the creed was understood. Constantine
was content to have the creed signed, leaving its interpretation
largely to the individual. Behind the scenes, however, there now
began a violent political struggle within the church. The Arians
who for the moment had been forced into retreat, continued to
have many followers. They took steps to fill as many vacant
episcopal sees as possible with members of their own party. But
the orthodox were also not idle, especially Athanasius, who had
become bishop of Alexandria in 328 and was to live until 373.
The power struggle was fierce, with both sides using means that
were often regrettable and with the actual differences of opinion
magnified by rather far-reaching misunderstandings of the
opponents’ position. Not all who rejected the Nicene confession were
true Arians. On the basis of Origenistic theology, however, they
were dissatisfied with the creed. It seemed to them that at
Nicaea the divine persons had not been sufficiently differentiated.
In their opinion Nicaea aided modalistic Monarchianism.
The members of the Nicene party, on the other hand, did not
always do justice to their opponents either. In the fifth century
the church historian Socrates (d. ca. 450) was already comparing
the Arian controversy with a battle fought in the dark, with
the combatants unable to distinguish friend from foe.
footnote:[Socrates, The Ecclesiastical History of Socrates Scholasticus, Bk. 1,
chap. 23. NPNF? 2, 27.]
Yet these often regrettable by-products should not lead one to
disregard the actual substance of the discussions.

Among the many persons who over the decades were involved
in the controversy, especially in the eastern part of the Roman
Empire, a few stand out. There is, first of all, Athanasius, and
then the three so-called Cappadocians. Each in his own way,
and yet in substantial agreement with one another, and with a
view to the real significance of the discussion, these men held
fast to the decision of Nicaea even while they were developing
it further in a very definite way. They realized, as few others
did, that Nicaea, with its condemnation of Arianism, did not
merely represent a climax in the development of the church’s
doctrine, but that it also imposed new tasks.

Athanasius has always been regarded as the real champion of
Nicaea. He fought for the homoousios as no one else did, yet
without a narrowly conceived insistence on it. He endured no
less than five banishments, some of them lasting many years,
merely because he held fast to the Nicene confession. He does
not belong to those theologians who independently and boldly
develop a system of their own. Apparently Athanasius never
pursued theology for the sake of theology. He gave himself to
it only for the sake of polemic. Yet, in spite of these
limitations, he was still an acute thinker. Relentlessly he continued to
point to the consequences implied in the position one takes
toward the problem of the consubstantiality of the Son with the
Father.

For the history of the doctrine of the Trinity, Athanasius has
above all a twofold significance. First, he became increasingly
aware of the need to understand the homoousios of Nicaea not
only as an assertion of the full deity of the Son but also in its
significance for the unity of God. It was in reference to this
latter point especially that Athanasius underwent a development.
During his early years he had laid no particular stress upon the
_homoousios_. In fact a certain reserve with respect to this
expression can be noted in his writings. It proved to be of
significance, therefore, that during his first banishment (at Treves,
335-337), as well as during his second banishment (in Rome
and Aquileia, 339-346), he became acquainted with the old
western doctrine of the Trinity. Since the days of Tertullian
this doctrine had emphasized the unity of God, and therefore
had understood the homoousios of Nicaea more in the sense of
the western tradition than in that of the council fathers, who
were predominantly Greek. From about 350 on, Athanasius was
the determined champion not only of the Nicene orthodoxy as
such, but especially of the term homoousios. While earlier in
his career Athanasius had emphasized especially the divinity of
the Logos, without expressing himself in detail about the unity
of God the Father and God the Son, he now accentuated above
all else the unity of God. The homoousios formula served this
purpose splendidly. On the other hand, Athanasius had to
reckon with the fact that emphasis on the homoousios meant
that the differences between the persons would not appear with
full clarity. It is of immediate importance, however, that
_homoousios_ is henceforth given a new meaning, in that it is made
to refer to the unity of God. Consequently Athanasius was now
able to point out that the divinity of the Son is identical with
the divinity of the Father, that, in fact, the divinity of the Son
is at the same time the divinity of the Father, or that the
fullness of the divinity of the Father is the being (_to einai_) of the
Son.
footnote:[Athanasius, Four Discourses Against the Arians,
Discourse III, chap. 6. NPNF? 4, 396-397.]
In doing this Athanasius certainly did not wish to fall
into the error of the Sabellians, as the Arians were charging that
he did. On the contrary, he held firmly to the idea that the
Father and the Son are "two." "They are one," he writes, "not —
as one thing divided into two parts, and these nothing but one,
nor as one thing twice named, so that the Same becomes at
one time Father, at another His own Son, for this Sabellius
holding was judged an heretic, But They are two, because the
Father is Father and is not also Son, and the Son is Son and
not also Father; but the nature is one. . . ."
footnote:[Athanasius, Four Discourses Against the Ari i
NPNE! 4 308° Againsi rians, Discourse III, chap. 4.]
What is not yet in this position is the difference between the
divine persons. Here the Cappadocians were to do further work.

Athanasius was of course never concerned with mere speculation.
His real interest was not in the doctrine of the Trinity
as such, but in soteriology, or the doctrine of redemption. Arius’
strict subordination of the Son to the Father, the Son being a
creature, meant that through Christ no full knowledge of God
was mediated. Athanasius had immediately recognized this
consequence of Arian theology and he never tired of pointing
it out. Conversely, Athanasius always insisted most emphatically
that only in holding fast to the consubstantiality of the Son with
the Father is it possible to preserve faith in redemption. If
Jesus Christ was only the manifestation of a created being,
half-divine in nature, then there is no real redemption through Christ.
In his early years Athanasius had already insisted, "It is we who
were the cause of His taking human form, and for our salvation
that in His great love He was both born and manifested
in a human body."
footnote:[Athanasius, The Incarnation of the Word of God, chap. 1, sec. 4, trans.
by a Religious of C. S. M. V., S.Th. (New York: Macmillan, 1946), p.29.]
Later Athanasius made this connection between the doctrine of God
and the doctrine of redemption even
more central in his teaching. Unless this connection is seen his
struggle for the recognition of the confession of Nicaea cannot
be understood.

It is precisely at this point, however, that misgivings have
often been expressed. They refer not to the connection of the
doctrine of God and the doctrine of redemption as such, but to
Athanasius’ understanding of redemption. His doctrine of redemption
is often referred to as "physical"; that is, it is said to
be concerned not merely with freedom from sin and guilt but
also, and above all, with the restoration and imperishability of
human nature, or, in ‘other words, with the deification of man.
Again and again this formula recurs in Athanasius: "He, indeed,
assumed humanity that we might become God."
footnote:[Athanasius, The Incarnation of the Word of God, chap. 8, sec. 54.
Ibid., p. 93.]
Later he was
to write, "Mankind then is perfected in Him and restored, as it
was made at the beginning, nay, with greater grace. For, on
rising from the dead, we shall no longer fear death, but shall
ever reign in Christ in the heavens. And this has been done,
since the own Word of God Himself, who is from the Father,
has put on the flesh, and become man."
footnote:[Athanasius, Four Discourses Against the Arians, Discourse I, chap. 67.
NPNF? 4, 385.]
On the basis of such assertions Harnack interpreted Athanasius
as saying that mortality in itself was the greatest evil and the cause of all other
evils, while the highest good was to live eternally.

Such accusations must be approached with caution. There can
be no doubt that even though Athanasius is familiar with the
idea that Christ frees us from sin and guilt, his soteriology
operates primarily with the categories of mortality and immortality.
Death is conquered by life. It should be noted, however, that
when the New Testament itself speaks of redemption, it, too,
does not limit itself to the conceptions of guilt and forgiveness,
or justification, but may on occasion set death and life over
against each other. This is true not only of the Johannine writings,
but also of certain passages in St. Paul. In this respect the
Reformation undoubtedly repeated the thoughts of the New
Testament with a certain one-sidedness. In doing so, however,
it simply remained true to the entire western tradition, whose
thought always inclined more to "ethical" concepts than did that
of the Eastern church, which from the beginning gave preference to
"physical" concepts. For Athanasius, furthermore, death
and life are not primarily "physical" concepts, but concepts
which are always filled with content. Death is separation from
God caused by guilt. It is the curse which came upon Adam
and all mankind. Life, on the other hand, is full communion
with God, which consists not simply in the forgiveness of guilt,
but which signifies a new being whose nature is no longer transitory but eternal.

In addition to Athanasius the three so-called Cappadocians
are also of great significance for the further development and
right understanding of the decision of Nicaea. Actually it was
they who created the intellectual and conceptual means for the
full appropriation of the Nicene confession. Their labors are
most closely connected with the question of the divinity of the
Holy Spirit.

### The Divinity of the Holy Spirit

In the Nicene confession relatively little was said of the Holy
Spirit. An assertion about faith in the Holy Spirit had been
deemed sufficient. The problem concerning the divinity of the
Son had been uppermost in the minds of the council fathers as
a result of the teaching of Arius. To it Nicaea gave its answer,
It did not seem necessary to proceed from the question of the
consubstantiality of the Son with the Father to the problem of
ascertaining the position of the Holy Spirit in the Godhead.

With the passage of time, however, it became increasingly
evident that it was not possible to rest content with the brief
affirmation of Nicaea. As the concept of homoousios necessarily
led to deeper reflection on the unity of the Father and the Son,
the church having been forced beyond the assertion of the di.
vinity of the Son to an insistence upon the consubstantiality of
the Father with the Son, so the question of the Holy Spirit was
now destined to become urgent. Once the alternative between
the divine and the created, which had been pointed out by
Arius, was seen in its full significance, the related problem of
the Spirit could not be avoided. Arius regarded the Spirit as a
being which totally lacked any similarity with either the Father
or the Son. Among other theologians, too, the uncertainty
concerning the doctrine of the Holy Spirit was greater than the
uncertainty about the homoousios of the Son. A man such as
Eusebius of Caesarea subordinated the Spirit to the Father and the
Son, teaching that the Spirit was the first of the creatures to be
brought forth by the Son. It is true that some theologians, for
instance, Cyril of Jerusalem, approximated later orthodoxy in
their teaching concerning the Spirit. Even among the adherents
of the confession of Nicaea there was still much uncertainty
about the question of what position the Spirit occupies in the
Trinity. The divinity of the Holy Spirit was especially rejected
by the so-called Pneumatomachians, who gathered about Macedonius,
Bishop of Constantinople (342-360).

Only at a rather late date did Athanasius have something to
say in his various letters to Serapion (359 or 360) concerning
the position of the Holy Spirit. In doing so he emphasizes that
according to the unambiguous testimony of Scripture the Holy
Spirit is not of a creaturely nature but belongs to God and is
one with the Godhead, namely, the Trinity. The Spirit comes
from God. He bestows sanctification and, indeed, life itself. The
Spirit is immutable, omnipresent, and one, while the creatures
are mutable, dependent upon time and space, and many.
Through the Spirit we partake of God. On the other hand, it
is not true that the Spirit partakes of others. He only communicates
himself. Thus Athanasius concludes that, without doubt,
the Spirit, too, is God, and that of him, too, consubstantiality
must be asserted. Athanasius emphasizes especially the connection
between the Spirit and the Son. As it is necessary to gain
the knowledge of the Spirit through the Son, so the Spirit is
inseparable from the Son. He is the Spirit of the Son, sent by the
Son. Everything that belongs to the Spirit belongs also to the
Son, as is evident in John 16:13-14. Thus Athanasius developed
a complete theology of the Trinity, in which, however, an appropriate
concept for that which we call "person" was missing.It was the
Cappadocians who led the way to greater clarity on this point.

The term "the three Cappadocians" refers to Basil the Great
(d. 379), Bishop of Caesarea and Metropolitan of Cappadocia;
Gregory of Nyssa (d. 394), a younger brother of Basil; and
Gregory of Nazianzus (d. ca, 390). They all came from old,
cultured families. They had steeped themselves in ancient
classical literature as well as in the church fathers. All
three were bishops and had promoted the ecclesiastical life
of their dioceses in many ways. Above all else, however, they
made an extraordinary contribution as theologians. Without their
intellectual labor the Arian controversy would hardly have ended in
the manner in which it did.

With reference to their intellectual and theological peculiarities
the Cappadocians differ basically from Athanasius. They
were not so concerned about ecclesiastical politics as he. Instead
they took their cue from Origen. Yet they had moved
toward the confession of Nicaea, affirming fully and completely
the decision of 325. At the same time they attempted to pursue
further the solution of the problems.

Among the Cappadocians the heritage of Origen is evident:
in their doctrine of God they proceed less from the unity of
the divine Being than they do from the three persons which,
they felt, must be differentiated from one another. Even so, they
emphasized the homoousios of the Son as well as that of the
Holy Spirit. Above all else, however, they developed a precise
terminology, in order to differentiate between the being of God
in general and the individual persons. While the terms ousia
(essence, substance) and hypostasis (essentiality, nature) were
used indiscriminately by the older Nicaeans, the younger Nicaeans
used the first concept for the common substance and the
second for the concrete expression, or personal existence. From
now on ousia becomes the technical expression for the Godhead
as such, while hypostasis now no longer means "nature" but
"person." Thus ousia refer¢ to the common substance of God,
and hypostasis to the special forms which this divine substance
assumes in the person of the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Spirit. This precise differentiation between concepts helped
greatly to clarify the doctrine of God.

Furthermore, the Cappadocians set forth much more sharply
the peculiarity of the persons of the Trinity than had been the
case previously. In this endeavor it was natural to begin with
the three names which were given to the persons of the Trinity.
Basil did this, and accordingly ascribed to the Father "fatherhood,"
to the Son "sonship," and to the Holy Spirit "sanctifying
power" or "sanctification." Or again the differences could be
pointed out by saying that the Father is "unbegotten," the Son
is "begotten," and the Holy Spirit "proceeds." As a result of
such careful differentiation, and as a result of the definition of
ousia and hypostasis, the three Cappadocians actually made possible
a true doctrine of the Trinity, a doctrine, namely, which
maintains both the unity and the difference of the persons. It
should also be remembered that at about the time when these
men were developing their doctrine Athanasius declared as orthodox
the interpretation of homoousios (of the same substance)
in the sense of homoiousios (similar in substance). Since, as has
been mentioned, homoousios had meanwhile been interpreted
in the sense of a numerical unity of the Father with the Son, it
could also be misunderstood in a Sabellian sense. The term homoiousios
was appropriate for removing this misunderstanding.

The stage had now been set for the conclusion of the long
trinitarian controversy. On the eve of the Council of Constantinople
(381), which was convoked to put an end to the long
arguments, Gregory of Nazianzus declared in a speech that it
was the destiny of his time to bring to full clarity the mystery
which in the New Testament was only dimly intimated. That
was a daring pronouncement, but it outlined the theological task
which had been given to that day.

At the council of 381 the definitions of the Nicene confession
were largely taken over, though at a few places changes were
made. These had to do especially with the third article, which
was greatly enlarged in order to witness also to the divinity of
the Holy Spirit. Because the resulting creed is not historically
attested until 451, attempts have been made in the past to assign
to this creed a place of historical origin other than the
council of 381, the Second Ecumenical Council. These attempts,
however, may be regarded as having been proved to be untenable.
footnote:[See J. N. D. Kelly, Early Christian Creeds, pp. 296-331.]
The Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, as this creed is
called, is worded as follows:

> We believe in one God the Father almighty, maker of heaven
and earth, of all things visible and invisible;

> And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God,
begotten from the Father before all ages, light from light, true
God from true God, begotten not made, of one substance with
the Father, through Whom all things came into existence, Who
because of us men and because of our salvation came down from
heaven, and was incarnate from the Holy Spirit and the Virgin
Mary and became man, and was crucified for us under Pontius
Pilate, and suffered and was buried, and rose again on the third
day according to the Scriptures and ascended to heaven, and sits
on the right hand of the Father, and will come again with glory
to judge living and dead, of Whose kingdom there will be no end;

> And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord and life-giver, Who proceeds
from the Father, Who with the Father and the Son is together
worshipped and together glorified, Who spoke through the
prophets; in one holy Catholic and apostolic Church. We confess
one baptism to the remission of sins; we look forward to the
resurrection of the dead in the life of the world to come. Amen.

In this creed a specific assertion of the consubstantiality of
the Spirit with the Father and the Son is missing. Yet, in
essence it is there. For one thing, the Spirit is also called "Lord."
Furthermore, it is emphasized that, together with the Father
and the Son, the Spirit, too, is worshiped and glorified as the
giver of life. Again, in the year 382 a new synod at Constantinople
specifically affirmed the consubstantiality and the full divinity
of the Holy Spirit, as well as his existence as a separate
hypostasis. In this document, which is addressed to the bishops
of the West who could not be present, the one Godhead of the
three divine persons is set forth. Based upon the theology of
the Cappadocians it says: "According to this faith there is one
Godhead, Power and Substance of the Father and of the Son
and of the Holy Ghost; the dignity being equal, and the majesty
being equal in three perfect essences [hypostascis] and three
perfect persons."

With the decision of Constantinople a specific problem of the
Christian faith was settled for the first time in the history of the
church in an authoritative and final way. While it is possible to
see in the creation of the New Testament canon, as well as in
the rule of faith, an initial dogma of the church, it must be admitted
that the decrees of Nicaea and Constantinople differ from
these in the sense that the major concern here is a specific article
of the faith, namely, the doctrine of God. Does this imply,
as has been so often asserted, a falling away of the church from
the Christianity of the New Testament? If the development of
the doctrine of the Trinity from its beginnings to the end of the
fourth century is seen in its totality, it becomes difficult to make
such an accusation. In fact, it is more correct to insist upon the
opposite, namely, that by means of this dogma the church
erected a barrier against the onslaught of the tidal wave of Hellenism,
which threatened to inundate the Christian faith. If the
word homoousios is taken in its original sense, which has been
set forth by recent research, it must be said that in 325 the
church confessed its faith in the divinity of Christ, and it did so
exclusively in an attempt to reject the Arian heresy. Basil said
at one time with reference to the term homoousios that, because
of the errors of the Arians, it became necessary to choose a clear
word, since Arius redefined the words of Scripture to suit his
own purposes. Neither at Nicaea nor at Constantinople was the
attempt made to plumb the depth of the divine mystery or to
define God’s essence. The intention was, rather, to indicate that
God himself encounters us in Jesus Christ, and that in the Holy
Spirit God himself is present within his church.

### The Right Interpretation of the Doctrine of the Trinity

If the council fathers had really been trying to fathom the
depth of God’s essence with their creed, it would mean, in effect,
that every interpretation of their decision is superfluous. In
that case it should be possible to see in the Nicene confession
and in the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed the kind of clarification
of the doctrine of the Trinity which would eliminate all
further investigation of this segment of Christian doctrine.
Neither the council fathers themselves, however, nor later theologians
understood the dogma of the Trinity in this fashion.
Quite to the contrary, as the declaration of consubstantiality in
325 led, of necessity, to a further deepening of the doctrine of
God, so, too, the creed of 381 did not put an end to work on the
doctrine of the Trinity. In fact, only after 381 was the necessity
felt for a more profound interpretation. This may be shown
by citing the example of Augustine.

When the council fathers assembled in 381 Augustine was not
yet a Christian. His Damascus hour did not come until 386,
From 395 on he was bishop of the little, insignificant North
African coastal city of Hippo Regius which today is called Bone.
The work of this man, who is, no doubt, the most important
Latin church father, covered a great variety of very different
areas. He advanced the theological study of the doctrine of sin
and grace as well as that of the doctrine of the church, the
latter a very controversial issue in the Africa of his day. His
teaching in reference to the sacraments set forth the
presuppositions for the total subsequent development of this doctrine
in the Middle Ages as well as at the time of the Reformation.
In The City of God he developed, on the basis of the Christian
faith, one of the most profound interpretations of history ever
offered. It is not surprising, therefore, that Augustine also
devoted attention to the doctrine of the Trinity, especially in the
fifteen books of his great work On the Trinity, on which he
worked, with interruptions, from 399 to 419. It is the greatest
work which was written about the Trinity in the ancient church.

In summarizing the basic thoughts of this work it must be
noted, first, that Augustine emphasized above all else the unity
of God. He saw clearly that the formula of the Cappadocians
concerning the one substance and the three persons, and even
more their interpretation of this formula, could lead to
misunderstandings. Their distinction between ousia and hypostasis,
between the common substance and the distinctive expression of
the individual persons, has been mentioned above. As we know,
the Cappadocians often emphasized the second alternative,
namely, the persons. In doing so they sometimes went very far.
For instance, they compared the concept ousia with the generic
concept "man," while they compared the individual hypostases
with certain men such as Peter, Andrew, or John. Using this
analogy, they taught that insofar as the ousia, the substance
common to all three, is concerned, they are human beings. Thus
they are of "one substance." On the other hand, this common
substance comes to definite expression only through concrete
personal existence.

This comparison was, of course, not a very happy one. It
emphasizes the difference between the persons of the Trinity
much more than it does their unity. It was thus possible for
the Arians to brand the Cappadocian doctrine of the Trinity as
polytheistic, and to do so with a certain appearance of justice.
Augustine, who strongly felt the unfortunate element in such a
comparison, sought to circumvent this reef on which the theology
of the Cappadocians threatened to run aground. As emphatically
as he could, he asserted that the Trinity is one God,
not three gods. Nor does God cease to be "simple" (simplex)
because of his threefoldness. It is noteworthy that Augustine
does not use the concept of substantia for the being of God, but
that of essentia. He avoids the expression substantia, because it
would seem to imply that God’s righteousness is attributed only
to his substance, whereas all the perfections which are ascribed
to him must, in fact, be regarded as one with his being. If the
concept of substantia were used, God would have to be regarded
as the bearer of his attributes. But that is impossible.
For instance, the greatness, or the goodness, or the eternity of
God are not something which must first be added to his substance.
God is great in himself, through his own greatness. The
same is true for the other so-called attributes of God. All of
them inhere in his essence.

This, however, leads immediately to a further consequence.
Absolute perfection and absolute being can be asserted only of
one. For that reason Augustine insists that it is the one God,
not each of the three persons in himself, who possesses a nature,
and who possesses one deity, one majesty, and one glory, as
well as one will and one operation. There is no activity, therefore,
in which only the Father, or only the Son, or only the
Holy Spirit is involved. Over against the world, God (ie., the
three persons of the Trinity) represents "one principle" (unum
principium).’
footnote:[Augustine, On the Trinity, Bk. V, chap. 14, sec. 15. NPNF! 3, 94-95.]
Augustine conceives the unity of the Trinity so
stringently that he asserts that not only the Father, but also the
Son and the Holy Spirit, were actively involved in the incarnation of the Son.
footnote:[Ibid., Bk. II, chap. 5, sec. 9. NPNF? 3, 40-42.]
To express this view Augustine created a
precise formula to the effect that the works of the Trinity are
not separable as regards the outside, which means that the three
persons of the Trinity always work in concert."
footnote:[ Augustine, Enchiridion, chap. 38. NPNF? 3, 250.]
Of no less importance are Augustine’s reflections on the concept of
the persons. He always had reservations about this concept. It is
indeed a highly problematical element in the doctrine
of the Trinity. While the Greek term hypostasis refers primarily
to a distinct personal existence, the Latin term persona frequently
includes also a distinct self-consciousness. It was extremely difficult
to find a fitting Latin equivalent for the Greek
word hypostasis. It should have been translated by the word
substantia, But this would have created the impression that
three divine substances were being taught, which would have
contradicted the homoousios of the Son and the Spirit with the
Father. In the Greek the term hypostasis had gained acceptance
very slowly, gradually forcing out other words which were
also problematical, such as prosépon (mask, face). Augustine
strongly felt the inadequacy of the term persona. He always
used it with hesitation, and as a rule substituted for it the
concept of relatio (relation). The three so-called persons, he said,
are not something different, each in himself. They are different
only in their relation to each other and to the world. While all
absolute properties such as perfection, goodness, and omnipotence
belong only to the Trinity in its oneness, the term _relatio_
refers to the inner life of God, as well as his relation to the
created world. For this reason, he held, it is not possible to
call the Trinity "Father" in the same sense in which it is
referred to as great, or good, or eternal. Such an assertion of
fatherhood could be made of the Trinity at best in a derivative
sense, e.g., in relation to the creatures adopted by God as his
children. Yet even in the derivative use of such appellatives
Augustine believed there is a difference between the persons
of the Trinity. While it is possible to call the entire Trinity
"Father" in a secondary sense, it is impossible to call the
Trinity "Son" as well: the concept of sonship does not in any way
apply to the other persons of the Trinity.
footnote:[Augustine, On the Trinity, Bk. V, chap. II, sec. 12. NPNF! 3, 93.]
What Augustine
means here is that the designations "Father," "Son," and "Holy
Spirit" do not express either a substantial, or a quantitative, or
a qualitative difference, because these do not even exist. What
the concept of the persons expresses is, rather, an eternal relation.
But this relation is not an accidens, i.e., something that is
added to "being," for such a relation would be subject to change.
The one God, then, is never Father only, or Son only, or Holy
Spirit only. He always was, and always will be, the one triune
God, namely, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

Thus Augustine, too, clings to the differences between the
"persons." Under no circumstances did he wish to deny the
unique element associated with each of the persons of the
Trinity. He rightly noted, however, that the concept of persons
is subject to misunderstanding. Augustine felt that this concept
was used only in order that the truth involved "might not be
left [wholly] unspoken." It did not express to him the actual
state of things."
footnote:[Ibid., Bk. V, chap. 9, sec. 10. NPNF 3, 92.]

The West has never left out of account this interpretation
which Augustine had given to the decisions of the councils of
Nicaea and Constantinople. It was he who played the decisive
role in warning Latin theology against the danger of tritheism
and in keeping it from succumbing to this danger. Appealing
to Augustine, Karl Barth rendered the concept of persona by
the use of the word "mode" [Seinsweise]
footnote:[CD 11, 400.]
There is yet another sense, however, in which Augustine sets an example for
our day. He closed his great work on the Trinity with a prayer
in which he asks God’s forgiveness in case he should have said
something which does not accord with the truth. "O Lord, the
one God," he prayed, "God the Trinity, whatever I have said in
these books that is of Thine, may they acknowledge who are
Thine; if anything of my own, may it be pardoned both by
Thee and by those who are Thine."
footnote:[Augustine, On the Trinity, Bk. XV, chap. 28, sec. 51. NPNF? 3, 228,]
No one should speak of
the mystery of the Trinity unless it be with such reverence. But
in our day it is perhaps even more essential to emphasize that
mere silence about this mystery is not enough.
