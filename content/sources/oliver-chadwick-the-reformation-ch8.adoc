## CATHOLIC REFORMATION

Tue name of Counter-Reformation suggests a fight against
Protestantism; There was a political aspect of the CounterReformation, a league of Catholic powers ready to crusade
against the new Protestant states. There was also a true
sense in which the fight against Protestantism encouraged
the reforming movement within the Roman Catholic
Church. But it did not create it. The conflict with Protestantism gave to reform a new edge, to cut through the vested
interests and administrative conservatism which 2
frustrated reform. It gave to reform a dynamic, a vitality, an
affection for ancient ways, and a mistrust of Protestant ways,

The vested interests were so powerful that no reformation,
not even a Catholic reformation, was possible without an
increase in the power of the secular state. Part of the difficulty was the independent power of the Church within each
state. Part of the, difficulty was the interest of the Roman
courtin maintaining all its financial and legal rights throughout the Church. Even a Catholic Reformation, in Spain,
France, or Southern Germany, had as on¢ consequence a
further restraint upon the power of Rome in those countries,
and derived its effective impetus as much from Catholic
sovereigns as from the moral and intellectual leadership of
popes or divines.

The fight against the Mohammedans in southern Spain
welded Spanish State and Church into a unity of crusading
fervour. The Spanish crown already exercised a decisive
power over the Church through the Inquisition, which was
a royal weapon, and through the normal restraints which a
national monarchy placed upon papal action, By 1550 the
wealth of the newly discovered Americas was flowing into
Spain; and new economic power, joined to the political
status given by royal marriages, elevated the country to a
leading place in the states of Europe. After 1562, France,
split in two, was out of the political race, and Spain became
the strongest power in Europe, without rival in means or
in influence. By its rule of the Duchy of Milan and of
Naples and Sicily it was able to dominate Italy, and the old
titanic conflict of the Middle Ages between Pope and
Emperor turned itself into petty bickerings between Pope
and Spanish king; but only bickerings, for after 1562 the
Pope depended as politically upon the king of Spain as ever
medieval Popes had depended upon Saxon or Hohenstaufen
or Angevin. Spain led the rest of Europe in military prowess, navigation, discovery. Spanish Catholicism was like a
magnet, attracting towards itself the Catholicism of the
Counter-Reformation.

Cardinal Ximenes, primate of Spain from 1495 to 1517,
conducted a reformation of the Spanish Church on lines
which would have been traditional if the royal power had
not been so directly engaged. He enforced poverty among
the monks and friars; dissolved religious houses which failed
to conform to his standards, or stripped them of their endowments and devoted the revenues to hospitals or to impoverished monasteries; compelled incumbents to reside
upon their benefices, to expound the Scriptures, and to educate children; and created the university of Alcald, designed
to train scholastic theologians and the clergy, where the
study of the Hebrew and Greek languages was encouraged.

Here the leading scholars, some of them imported from
Italy, warmly adopted the reforming and critical ideas of
Erasmus. In the Spanish Netherlands, Vives edited St
Augustine and devised enlightened schemes of education.
Perhaps in no other country in Europe were the principles
of Erasmus so zealously adopted, by a few eminent men, as
a guide to reform. They were subjected to a battery of
criticism in 1520-2 by a heresy-hunter, Zuniga, who tried
to persuade the Spanish that Erasmus was responsible for
Luther, but without evident success. Alcal4 rivalled Sala=
manca for the intellectual primacy of Spain. Between 1502
and 1517 a group of scholars, under the personal direction
of Ximenes, produced the Polyglot Bible in six volumes, a
Bible in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin texts, and a critical
apparatus. The volumes were to be sold only with papal
approval (not obtained until 1520) and therefore the publication was delayed until 1522, and the New Testament of
Erasmus was known in western Europe before the Polyglot
version. The critical attitude of the cardinal was more conservative than the critical attitude of Erasmus, but his
scholarship was by no means inferior. In 1512 appeared a
Castilian translation of the Gospels and Epistles, frequently
reprinted, so that the Spaniard had little difficulty in buying
a copy in his own tongue.

But after 1530 the Erasmians of Spain encountered the
disapproval of the Inquisition. They were a small group of
educated men, and their ideals took no hold among the
people or among most of the Spanish clergy or monks. In
1537 the Inquisition prohibited the reading in Castilian
of the works of Erasmus, and ordered his Latin editions to
be expurgated. The inquisitors began to expect, and to hunt,
Lutherans. They found a little evidence. A group in Seville
was discovered to have smuggled Spanish Bibles from
Geneva. Solemn burnings in 1558-60 destroyed the few
powerless Protestants, and probably some others. Once in
the chase, the inquisitors were hard to satisfy. In Italy the
destruction of Protestantism was as rapid.

### New Orders

Medieval Catholicism sought its highest expressions of
devotion in the monastic life. The age-old method. of reforming the church was to found new orders, or new forms
of old orders. In Italy and Spain new orders were founded
during the first half of the sixteenth century. It was easier to
found new orders than to reconstruct the old, partly because
reformers, even within a religious community, are always
likely to divide it, and partly because the monastic endowments across Europe were part of that system of worldly
‘wealth and vested interest which was the most conservative
force in the Church. Single monasteries or groups succeeded
in reforming themselves, and some houses needed no reform.
‘The most successful attempt at reconstructing an old order
was that of Matteo da Bascio (died 1552), an Italian Franciscan of peasant stock who sought to revive the primitive
simplicity of St Francis of Assisi and to observe the letter of
the testament of St Francis, He insisted upon a beard, and
wore a four-pointed hood upon his coarse brown habit. He
later left his group and became an itinerant evangelist; but
the group was recognized by the Pope in 1528, and the
name of Capuchin — from the brown pointed hoods — is
first found in a papal document of 1535. The Capuchins
directed themselves to pastoral charity, lepers, hospitals,
popular evangelism, eschewed those magnificent houses and
city churches of older Franciscans, refused to encourage
scholarship, and built little communities of mud or wattle
far out in the country or mountain. They were fought’at
every turn by the Observant Franciscans, whom they were
silently criticizing by their reform and from whom they were
attracting good men. They endured an attempt at forcible
‘suppression during the thirties, and they were almost suppressed when their superior, Bernardino Ochino, most
popular of Italian preachers, turned Protestant (1542).
Until 1572 they were prohibited from founding houses outside
Italy, but thereafter they spread rapidly, and second to the
Jesuits were the great religious order of the CounterReformation. The fear of towns and of scholarship was
modified, and in 1619 the order at last acquired formal
independence. The Capuchins, in a manner, were typical of
what friars could do to reform the Church.

But most of the new orders were of a new age, and a new
spirit — Theatines (founded by Gaetano da Thiene in 1524) 5
Somaschi (1532); Barnabites (1533); Jesuits; and looser
groups named ‘oratories’, like that brotherhood: of prayer
and pastoral works in Rome called The Oratory of Divine
Love (1516), or the group of secular priests founded by St
Philip Neri in 1575, which raised thename of Oratory into
that of a great religious institute. Though these orders were
in a line of descent reaching back through the friars, their
ethos and their institutions were novel. They were not withdrawn from the world. Their intention was pastoral endeavour and parochial renewal. They lived. severe lives,
preached, established orphanages or hospitals or homes for
fallen women, educated children, and undertook the relief
of the sick or destitute, Even the new order for women, the
Ursulines (1595), at first designed its members to live at
home and worship in their parish churches while they lived
the life of charity and social endeavour. If we seek a single
theme running through the reforming endeavours of the
Catholic Reformation, it would be the quest for a more ade~
quate clergy — better-trained and better-instructed priests,
priests resident in their parishes, bishops resident in their
sees, pastors fervent and self-sacrificing and missionary>
minded, trained as confessors, celibate, mortified, able to
teach in school, wearing canonical dress; a priesthood uncorrupted and incorruptible, educated and other-worldly.
From Gaetano da Thiene near the beginning of the century
to St Philip Neri near the end, the conservative reformers
directed themselves to this end. And in spite of the novelty
of their ideas or institutions, they were proving that the
traditional ways of the Middle Ages were practicable. There
might, for example, be legitimate argument whether the
enforced celibacy of the clergy’ was Scriptural, or desirable,
or harmful, or useful; but the Counter-Reformation gave an
answer to those radicals who argued that in the light of
medieval concubinage it was impossible.

## THE JESUITS

Ignatius Loyola appears first in the pages of history during
1515, at Pamplona in Navarre, accused of ‘great crimes’ in
though he has not deserved it, lifting him little by little from
the proximity of agonies to contemplate the peace and the
glory of Mount Sion, ‘from living upon Calvary to living
with the Resurrection. The month was planned to lead to an
act of will — the choice of a new way of life. This new way is
to be lived by obedience to the teaching and the ordinances
of the Church. Obedience to a superior is the condition of a
soldierly service of God and of a total self-abnegation in the
individual. The soul undertook to obey the Church, as the
bride of Christ, and to sacrifice its own judgement; to practise confession, frequent communion, the recitation of the
hours of prayer; to maintain such institutions of the Church
as monasteries, the celibacy of the clergy, relics, fasting,
indulgences, pilgrimages; and to defend the scholastic theology, the Church’s tradition and the decrees of the Popes.
The book ends with ‘Rules for Thinking with the Church’.
In these rules comes the celebrated hyperbole that he is to
be ready to believe that what seems to him white is black,
if the Church declares it to be so. (Contrary to a common
opinion, however, it has been shown that for many years
there'was no regularity about the practice of these exercises
by Loyola’s disciples.)

In 1523 Loyola went as a pilgrim to Jerusalem. In 1526
he was a student at AlcalA preparing himself for ordination.
His rigours and his little groups of prayerful friends made
the Spanish Inquisition suspicious of him, and for a time he
was imprisoned. He tried again at Salamanca and was
imprisoned. In 1528 he tried again at the University of
Paris, where he was again denounced to the Inquisition. He
had begun at last to learn wisdom and prudence in picking
his disciples. At Paris in 1534, his first six men joined him
in a brotherhood — Francis Xavier, also from Pamplona,
Faber (Pierre Le Févre), Lainez, Salmerén, Bobadilla,
and Rodriguez.

In a chapel on Montmartre (15 August 1534) the little
band vowed to go to Palestine to work for the conversion of
the Turks; or if this proved to be impossible, to offer themselves to the Pope to be sent on.any work which he
even if it were a mission, to the Turks or other persec
powers. By 1538 it was clear that Palestine was impossible;
and though the mind of Xavier was already turning towards
the Indies, they offered themselves to the Pope. They had
become aware of the crying needs of Italian parishes, and
became known as educators of children, as conductors of ~
missions or retreats, as popular’ preachers, as chaplains’ to
hospitals, At Rome in the spring of 1539 they formed a
‘Company of Jesus’ which was to instruct the children and
the illiterate in the commandments of God. Its members
were to take a special view of obedience to the Pope, to go
wherever the Pope should send them. The priests of the
Company, though bound to recite the hours of prayer, were
not to do so in choir, that they might not be withdrawn from.
the works of charity.
It was not a good time for founding new orders. In the
Papal court, reform made a stumbling beginning under
Pope Adrian VI (1522-3), remained quiescent or worse
under Clement VII (1523-34) and by 1539, with Paul IIT
as Pope, began markedly to influence public opinion in
Rome. Persons with revolutionary ideas could be found in
high places. The canonist Guidiccioni, whom the Pope
consulted about the Jesuits, believed that all the existing
male orders except four (perhaps except one) should be ©
suppressed, At last, on 27 September 1540, the Society was
established by a Bull entitled Regimini militantis ecclesiae,

The Society was in’ no sense designed to be a weapon for
fighting the Protestants. Nor at first had it any reputation
for intransigence. The Bull of 1540 declared its object to be
the propagation of the faith, and the phrase ‘propagation
and defence’ of the faith was not added till 1550. Nor was it
in origin an autocratic society. Ignatius himself was less
autocratic by temperament than John Wesley. But between
1540 and 1555 the Society grew so rapidly in numbers,
influence, and range of activities that it could only be
directed, perhaps could only have been held together, by a
strong hand at the centre. And’ while Ignatius was not
temperamentally an autocrat, and would probably have
been content if another had governed the society which he
had founded, he stamped it with his own religious ideals
and therefore with the virtue of obedience at the centre of
its devotional life. The rule of obedience taught in The
Spiritual Exercises was not new. It may be paralleled in the
rules of St Francis of Assisi, and its origins go back to the’
Rule of St Benedict and beyond. Yet he succeeded in imparting into his Society an atmosphere of religious obedience
which easily fitted the autocratic constitution desirable for
practical reasons, and which culminated in the special
promise of obedience made to the Pope by fully professed
members of the Society.

They intended to be a society of priests ministering to the
heathen and the poor, and especially educating the children
or the illiterate. Ignatius spent much energy in resisting the
tendency of his more devotional followers to turn the
society into a conventional, even amore contemplative, order.
They established orphanages, houses for prostitutes, schools,
centres of poor relief, in Sicily even a kind of banking
institute for destitute peasants. Others among the new
orders modified the obligation of the religious to say the
offices in choir, but Ignatius carried this to a revolutionary
abolition. There should be no common recitation of the
office; thus the oldest obligation of the monastic community
disappeared.

It is interesting to observe the balance with which the
mature Ignatius, once a zealot and ascetic extremist, ruled
his order. Though he maintained a severe and austere life
for himself, he would allow no one to practise discipline so
strenuously as to harm his health. He would even force
some young ascetic, discovered to have been fasting beyond
the rule, to eat a meal in his presence. His men were to be
fit for hard work in the world. The success of the Jesuits
sprang largely from this readiness to adjust the old ideals of
the monks to the needs of the new generation.

The hierarchy of the order was complex. The novitiate,
lasted two years instead of one, and was different from the
old enclosed novitiates in containing a period of work ina
hospital and a barefoot pilgrimage. Then the novice took
the simple vows of poverty, obedience, and chastity, and
passed into the ‘scholasticate’, where he received a severe
course of higher education, and might be received-at the end
into full profession of vows and membership of the Society.
If received, he could later be allowed to take a fourth vow,
that of personal obedience to the Pope; and those ‘professed
of the fourth vow’ were the governing body of the Society.
They were not numerous — in 1556 they were only 43 in
number, out of 1,000 members. This governing body was
summoned only to elect a General or at the will of the
General (except in exceptional circumstances where the
General was insane or incapable), and the General: held
office for life, restricted only by the advice of four elected
assistants. The constitution in theory attributed no more
power to the General, and exacted no more obedience from
the fathers, than some medieval orders. But the old abbot
had been limited by custom and enclosure and a body of
tradition and a written rule, whereas the Jesuit General was
administering a new body which needed strong government
to control its rapid expansion and harmonize its various
activities.

Their work became diverse as their numbers grew. The
mission to the heathen was not allowed to drop — perhaps,
indeed, it always remained as primary to the Society as
were the struggles against the heretics. On 7 April 1541
Francis Xavier, with three Jesuit companions, embarked at
Lisbon for the Indies. He was the first of a long line of
missionaries to the Indies and the Americas.

In 1540 the Society was still a little group, primarily for
education and pastoral work among the poor. By 1556,
when Ignatius died, it had more than 1,000 members and
had become one of the powerful forces in the Catholic
world, by its ministry not to the poor but to the upper ranks.
This happened chiefly through its hold upon higher education. It began by teaching the urchins of the Roman slums.
It ended by teaching princes and princesses.

The Franciscans had begun by a ministry to the poor and
had soon produced professors at the university. The parallel
extension of the Jesuit work was less of a change than among
the Franciscans. Education of children, to be effective, must
lead them upwards. The primary school cannot be efficient
unless the secondary school is efficient, and the secondary
school will not be efficient unless the university is efficient.
The first Jesuit secondary school was opened at Messina in
1548. The good sense of Ignatius exacted modern methods,
fresh air and exercise, admirable teaching of Latin in the
spirit of the Renaissance, care of good manners. Soon they
were educating the upper classes of Catholic Europe. And
meanwhile, colleges were founded in university after university, the first at Padua in 1542, the chiefat Rome in 1551.
The Company of Jesus became a teaching order, the leading
body engaged in the higher education of Catholics, And
since its educational methods were effective, more effective
than any other methods in contemporary Europe, it found
itself educating aristocrats and kings. The association of the
Jesuit with the Catholic court, an association to be perilous
to both sides, was founded upon intelligent schoolmastering.

The Jesuits in Germany

Teaching the Catholic faith in the universities, they were
brought into direct controversy with the swiftly spreading
influence of the Protestant divines. Their own plan of
reform encountered notions of Reform, and those notions
in absolute conflict with their ideals of obedience to the Holy
Roman Church, Their study of theology was first for
pastoral uses, then for controversial uses, and finally it
became an end in itself, an academic discipline. Ignatius,
despite painful diligence, was never a scholar. But two of his
original six, Lainez and Salmerén, rapidly gained a place
among the leading theologians of Catholic Europe and were

 

 
 

The Counter-Reformation
among the Pope’s more stalwart defenders at the Council of
Trent. And from the moment (1542) that Jesuit Fathers
were summoned by Catholic bishops to work in Southern
Germany, they found that they were at once leading
resistance to Protestant thought and seeking to confute
Protestant theologians. In 1549 they began to teach at the
Bavarian University of Ingolstadt, henceforth their German
base. In 1552 the German college was founded in Rome;
and from that time Ignatius regarded the battle against
heresy as a primary task of his Company. He was succeeded’
as General by Lainez, the ablest theologian and controversialist among the early members,

For in 1555 sober men thought that the conservative
cause in Germany was lost. Protestantism was still spreading
in the Catholic lands like Austria, Bavaria, and Bohemia.

It had been difficult for the old theologians to resist the
new theologians, except at the most superficial level of
controversy. John Eck, by his cleverness, produced little
handbooks which scored points against the Protestants. But
at a deeper level the learned divines had been on the side
of Reform, The universal belief that reform was necessary,
the aridity and staleness of the older scholastic tradition, its
fruitlessness in a world dominated by the insights of humanism, the second-rate quality of many of the defenders ~ these
rendered the traditionalist apologetic scanty and unconvincing, during the first forty years of reform. There were
exceptions; Spanish friars like Alfonso a Castro or Dominic
Soto were already in the forties and fifties creating a new
apologetic towards Protestantism. But as scholarship improved and confidence returned, as the theologians found
much common ground with the Protestants in the study of
the Bible and of the ancient Church, the controversy be
came less unequal. The conservatives discovered how in the
new world they could defend the old ways, and were sometimes surprised to find that the old ways were defensible.

In Germany the Catechism of the Jesuit Peter Canisius
(published in 1555) is a mark of this changing atmosphere.
It was written in a style to be understood, it was lucid and
attractive and supported by Biblical texts, it was not (as a
catechism by Eck would have been) armed to the teeth
against assailants. It was an uncontroversial statement of the
Catholic faith, and won praise even among Protestant
divines. Canisius toured the Catholic south, stirring the
princes to the defence of their religion, disputing and preaching, founding colleges and institutions. For much of the
century even informed Germans supposed that the founder
of the Jesuits was Canisius.

It should not be forgotten that controversial disputations
or pamphlets formed one of the least important parts of the
battle against the Protestants. The only way to counter the
Protestants was to reform the Church. In the Bavaria of
1550, for example, all the old abuses were continuing, and
continuing in spite of a pious prince. The clergy were often
illiterate, the monasteries often like country inns, the vicarages commonly contained a concubine and numerous
progeny, there were many drunken priests. This was the
condition which invited the Reforming ideals from the
north to spread southward, and some of the Bavarian middle
class were already affected by the teaching of the Lutherans
or of the Anabaptists. The only way to stem the tide was to
reform the Church. It was pastoral endeavour as well as
militant antagonism which was at the base of the CounterReformation advance in South Germany, ‘The best way to
fight the heretics is not to deserve their criticisms,’ said the
nuncio Bonomi in 1585, But this pastoral endeavour was an
action of the state. In Bavaria the pious prince Albert summoned Jesuits to his aid and reformed the parishes of his
duchy with a soldierly severity. And to expel heretics or
destroy Anabaptists or burn false books was for every Catholic sovereign a part of his endeavours to reform his parishes.

## CONTARINI AND CARAFFA

The Protestants - Luther, Henry VIII (if he was a Protestant), Calvin ~ appealed to a future General Council of
the Church. The memory of the fifteenth-century councils
was still potent. The most traditional of reformers looked to
a General Council to reform the Church in head and members and, after the German revolt, to bring peace. The difficulty lay in the question when a General Council was free,
who might attend it, and what might be its agenda. Papal
divines held that the Pope alone had the canonical right to
summon a General Council. Protestant divines could not
expect, or did not expect, fair dealing at a Council summoned and arranged by their principal opponent. A
moderate peacemaker, like the Emperor Charles V, was
confronted with the formidable and unlikely task of summoning, or causing to be summoned, a Council which
sensible men upon either side would recognize to be a true
Council, of an authority and prestige comparable with the
great Councils of the primitive Church.

Many moderates, especially in Germany, were passive in
the growing schism because they looked for remedy to a
future Council. They might not want Luther, but they
wanted reform, and they suspected the Popes of failing to
call a Council because they wished not to be reformed. The
Germans wanted ‘a free Christian Council in German
lands’. By ‘free’, most Germans meant that it must be independent of the papacy. The Emperor Charles V wished the
Council to meet in Germany, partly because he was a good.
Catholic and partly because he wanted and needed a
united Germany.

The Pope and his advisers followed their predecessors of a
century before in eyeing with suspicion and fear any Council
which a German Emperor, however Catholic, might convoke. Their fear sprang as much from the fact that the vested
interests of the papal court were afraid of the ‘reform in head
and members’ on which everyone was theoretically agreed,
as from the memory that any General Council raised constitutional hindrances to the freedom of papal action. They
remembered how the Council of Basle had lectured. the
popes like a nagging wife. They remembered how the
Council of Constance had deposed popes'and elected a new
pope. They’ feared that'a General Council outside their
control would conduct a revolution in which Catholicism
would be transformed and the See of Rome swept into
insignificance. They admitted that sooner or later a Council
‘must be held, but they were determined that 
should be under the presidency of the Pope or his legates,
should be held in the traditional manner’ with bishops
attending, and should be as immediately under the direction of the Pope as the Lateran Council of 1512-17. They
thought that the popes were capable of reforming the
Church by papal decree, so far‘as it needed reform. If a
Council could not be avoided, it should be held at Rome or
in the papal dominions. They sometimes believed that no
new decrees were needed, and that the nations needed only
to enforce the existing canon law. ‘What is the point of a

Paul III Farnese (Pope 1534-49) was the Pope who
recognized that a General Council must willy nilly be summoned, and abandoned the policy of his predecessors that
a Council must at all costs be avoided lest Rome perish in
the ensuing constitutional conflict. In his personal habits
Paul was no great example of a reformed Pope, for he
suffered from a numerous and avaricious family. But reformed or not, he was convinced by the urgent need to
reform the Church from within. And his performance was
courageous. Though he elevated a nephew aged fourteen
to be a Cardinal and sent the red hat to his school, he also
elevated several Catholic leaders of reforming zeal or
humanist sympathy: Fisher, Contarini, Sadoleto, Caraffa,
Pole. The reformers were given an immediate opening:
In 1536 he appointed a commission of nine — including
Sadoleto, Caraffa, Contarini, and. Pole —- to produce.a
memorandum on reform. In 1537 they issued a Report ofa
Select Committee... on Reforming the Church (Consilium de
Emendanda Ecclesia). They recommended that residence be
made compulsory, that a certain standard should) be
exacted of persons to be admitted to benefices. Though they
were oddly silent upon ignorance and the need of education,
they recognized the peril in indulgences and superstitious
devotions. They were unpalatably frank in their denunciations of monastic abuses, the misuse of episcopal authority,
the avarice and irresponsibility of the cardinals, the prostitutes in the city of Rome, and the claims of extreme canonists that the Pope, even if he sold benefices, could not commit simony. Unpalatably frank, for the text soon leaked out:
and was published by Protestants in Germany. A picture
was circulated of three cardinals sweeping a church with
foxes’ tails instead of brooms.

The Catholic Church was no monolithic uniform structure. The medieval Church contained a wide range of
opinion, and now the Pope found himself pressed by two
different schools. Everyone agreed upon reform. But must
reform mean an approximation towards the Protestants,
conciliation and concession, an allowing of clerical marriage
or the cup to the laity, an eschewing of the admitted abuses
of the doctrine of merit by encouraging a more Scriptural
teaching of justification by faith? Or was reform rather to
be obtained by fighting the Protestants, refusing all concession, developing the unprotestant elements of devotion in
the medieval tradition, strengthening the authority of the
hierarchy?

The history of the Counter-Reformation is in part the
history of the triumph of the conservatives and the militant
over the conciliatory and the liberal.

Among the cardinals elevated by Paul III and among the
authors of the Consilium de Emendanda Ecclesia, two have been.
seen as symbols of the rival schools: Cardinal Contarini
who patronized the early Jesuits, and Cardinal Caraffa who
organized the Theatines. Contarini footnote:[Despite many histories, he had not been a member of the Oratory of Divine Love at Rome.]
 studied. philosophy
among the humanists, was then a civil servant in the city of
Venice, attending the famous 1521 Diet of Worms as the
Venetian ambassador, and was still a layman when Pope
Paul III made him a cardinal in 1535. Humane and
courteous, he was for seven years the guide and inspirer of
the Catholic Reformation. He believed that the Protestants
had a measure of truth in their pleas upon merit, and to
express the doctrine of justification he was ready to find
formulas which would satisfy both Protestant and Catholic.
He believed that the traditional abuses, even the highest,
even the abuses of the Roman Curia, must be ended.

### Colloquy of Ratisbon, 1541

The policy of conciliation reached its climax in the Colloquy
of Ratisbon in 1541. There Contarini, accompanied by the
most moderate of German Catholic divines, and possessing
vague but liberal-sounding instructions from Pope Paul III,
sat round a table with the most moderate of German
Protestant divines, Melanchthon and Bucer. Contarini
‘exceeded his instructions. The ‘Pope demanded that the
supremacy of the Pope must be recognized at the outset.
Contarini saw that tlie demand /would wreck the conference,
and postponed it to the last item on the agenda. John Eck,
who though no moderate was attending the conference,
caused trouble to the pacific programme but was at last
brought to heel. And under Contarini’s leadership the
conference attained the astonishing success of agreement
upon the doctrine of justification by faith.

Moderate men who engage in ecumenical conferences
need to remember that not all the members of their respective churches are moderate men. Luther was suspicious
when he heard what was happening. He found the agreement incredible. In Rome Cardinal’ Caraffa protested
bitterly against the theological betrayal. The French king,
Francis I, suddenly afraid that the Emperor Charles’ V
might succeed in uniting Germany on the basis ofa religious
peace at Ratisbon, protested with equal vehemence against
the concessions. The German Catholics of the right wing
thought that concession was illusory, and must go further,
to intolerable limits if it was to satisfy the Lutherans.
Meanwhile the conference at Ratisbon was itself breaking
down upon the article of transubstantiation, which Contarini could not abandon and the Protestants could not
accept. Pope Paul III declared that he would not tolerate
ambiguous formulas, and the opportunity of peace had gone.

In Italy Cardinal Contarini found himself everywhere
rumoured to be a heretic. He died in the next year, 1542.

The failure of Contarini opened the way to the opposing
party, Reconciliation was now believed to be a mirage, and
the proper policy for the Church was to define its doctrine
and condemn error more precisely.

In the same year that Contarini was at Ratisbon, Caraffa
recommended the Pope to found a new and powerful
Inquisition into heresy. He and his school believed that the
way to purify Catholicism was by assaults upon heresy, and
that the policy of conciliation was encouraging the growth
of heresy. A small but distinguished crop of Italian conversions to the Protestants during 1542, including the famous
Bernardino Ochino of the Capuchins and Peter Martyr
Vermigli of the Augustinians, lent substance to the belief,
The Roman Inquisition was founded by a Bull (Licet’ ab
initio) of 21 July 1542, appointing six cardinals (including
Caraffa) as inquisitors-general and subjecting all Catholics
to their authority. They were given power to imprison on
suspicion, to confiscate property, and to execute the guilty,
while the power of pardon was reserved to the Pope.
Caraffa would not wait for a grant from the papal treasury,
but bought a house which he fitted with offices and dunworld;
a difference not dependent upon the contrast of the
‘individual:personalities. By 1559 the Catholic Reformation,
so'hopelessly longed. for by godly men throughout the past
idecades, had at last attained power in Rome. It is true that
individuals governed and directed the change. But it is not
‘only a:contrast of individuals..It would have: been almost
unthinkable for the Pope of 1459 to be elected in 1559, or
vice versa. On the one side is a world of Italian Renaissance:
gay, humane, corrupt, reasonably content with the old
ways and the old abuses, still thinking of crusades against
the Saracens when it thought of crusades at all, valuing the
ascetic life deeply but regarding the ascetics as men to be
admired rather than imitated by the world. On the other
side is a world in earnest: seeking discipline and order, not
only admiring the friars but wanting the Church to conform
to the ascetic or puritan pattern, suspicious of nudes and
pagan statues, fiercely struggling to diminish or eradicate
'the venality of church administration.

The atmosphere of religious, moral, and intellectual life
was being transformed. Bishops who had once been tranquil
in their non-residence now issued circulars denouncing nonresidence. Secretaries who once drafted the seamier docu‘ments of the indulgence traffic were now loud in denouncing
the abuses of the indulgence. Humanists who once hired
their pens to immoral literature were not ashamed to
publish books of devotion. In the fifteen-fifties some of
them still inserted pagan phrases or legends into their
writings to the Pope, but the phrases now looked strange.
Peter Aretino had lived in a kind of harem at Venice and
made money out of writing obscenities and panegyrics,
While the Counter-Reformation triumphed, he engaged
in writing ascetic books, acquired a reputation for pious
fervour and hatred of heretics, and died in 1556 as a
Chevalier of St Peter, asserting with brazen effrontery that
he had refused the offer of a cardinal’s hat.

Learned Italy was returning to the piety of the Church;
Italian poets were turning to sacred poetry, Italian artists
to devout practice. And not only in Italy was the atmosphere changing. The Portuguese Inacio de’Azevedo was the
son of a priest, the grandson of a bishop, the son and the
grandson. of nuns. When he learned of his birth, he held it
to be a fourfold sacrilege, believed himself called to a life
of sacrificial reparation; joined the Society of Jesus and its
Brazilian mission, and was murdered by pirates in midAtlantic. The wave of moral severity, which in another
part of Europe was creating puritanism, was now strengthening the hand of the Catholic reformers,

## THE COUNCIL OF TRENT

The Council of Trent is important, in the first place,
because it failed to meet until 1545. ee
The Cardinals, if they must have a Council, wanted it at
ee The Emperor Charles V was determined to havea
il in Germany. For long years papal diplomacy was
directed to securing that a Council never rk The legate
Aleander offered welcome advice to Pope Clement VII:
‘Never offer a Council, never refuse it directly. On the
contrary, show you are willing to comply with the request,
but stress the difficulties in the way. Thus you will be able to
ward it off.’ ‘Commit yourself to nothing,’ the legate
Cervini warned Pope Paul III at the eleventh hour, ‘until
itis agreed that the Pope is absolute master of the Council.”
The postponement, perhaps a fatal postponement for ©
Christendom, was made easier because Charles V was
usually at war with the King of France. France, fearing a
united Germany, feared a General Council. The French
king was almost as anxious as the Roman cardinals to put
off the Council indefinitely. After repeated false starts under
Pope Paul III, who saw that the danger in not summoning
was now greater than the danger in summoning, the
Council was at last enabled to meet in 1545, because the
Emperor and the French king signed the Peace of Crépy
in 1544, containing a’ secret Clause’ whereby King’ Francis
* pledged himself to further the Emperor's plans for a Council.
~~ As early as 1524 the name of Trent was mentioned as a
" possible site: a little town on the south side of the Alps and
“the Brenner pass, under the rule of a Catholic bishop, ‘in
“Italy, easy of access to Italian bishops, and yet also within:
the Holy Roman Empire and therefore complying with the
‘German demand that the Council must meet ‘in German
lands’.
The Council of Trent opened after an infinity of delays
~ upon 13 December 1545, with only twenty-eight bishops
present. The Emperor and the Pope wanted the Council
to perform different functions. The Emperor hankered for
religious peace in Germany, by reforming the abuses and
corruptions of the Church and by giving to the Lutherans.
} certain concessions, like the marriage of the clergy and
we “communion in both kinds. He therefore desired the Council
to attend to the questions of discipline and leave the
p questions of doctrine, which his experience of divines led
him to think insoluble. The Pope on the contrary instructed
his legates, who presided, that the Council must first treat
the questions of doctrine. It was therefore agreed that
doctrine and discipline should be treated in parallel. But
of the three sessions during which the Council sat (1545-8,
1551-2, 1562-3) the first was chiefly concerned with the
doctrinal definitions believed needful upon the questions
in controversy with the Protestants, and the last was chiefly
concerned with those efforts at disciplinary regulation and
correction which the traditionalists meant when they used
the word reform.
The Fathers of the Council felt no obligation to be
' tender to the Protestants. In the session of 1545-8 they were!
mainly from areas unaffected by Protestant ideas, and they’
wished to condemn what appeared to them to be erroneous
‘doctrines. Confronted by the doctrine of justification by
faith alone, they declared that faith alone was not sufficient!
for justification, but must be accompanied by hope and
love. Confronted by the Protestant appeal to the Scripture,
they declared that unwritten traditions and Scripture were
to be received with equal reverence, Confronted by. the
Protestant declaration that the sacraments of the Gospel
were three or two in number, they affirmed that the sacraments were neither more nor less than seven. Protestant
scholars believed that the Hebrew Bible was the source of
the authentic text, and therefore putithé Greek apocrypha
upon one side as instructive for morals but uncanonical
(the question had never been settled by the medieval
theologians), The Fathers of Trent declared that the Latin
Vulgate was the canonical and sacred text. The Protestant
divines believed that the doctrine of a repeated sacrifice of
Calvary in the mass, a doctrine which they attributed too
sweepingly to the Catholic divines,-was perilous and unscriptural; and they abolished ‘private masses’ root
and branch. The Fathers of Trent declared that in the
mass there was a truly propitiatory sacrifice of Christ, and
commended those masses at which the priest alone communicated. The Protestants contended that the liturgy
should be in a language understood by the people. The
bishops declared that the mass should normally continue
to be in Latin.

These definitions or decisions effectively ended the hopes
of the Emperor and other moderates’ that the Council
might seek a measure of reconciliation with the Protestants.
It is not to be denied that the fear of Protestantism led the
bishops towards direct confutation of its doctrines. There
were rumours in the Council, from time to time, that
Protestant armies were marching upon Trent. The bishops
sometimes felt themselves to be legislating under an imminent threat from heretical force. In 1552 a Protestant
army under Maurice of Saxony was but a few hours’
march from Trent, and the Council hastily adjourned. But
it should be observed that the doctrinal decrees of Trent,
because they were sometimes given a polemical tone,
sounded more hostile to the Protestants than they really
were, In the early sessions of the Council, when’ the most:
‘momentous ‘of the doctrinal’ decrees were’ passed, the
numbers of bishops present (about sixty) was still compara‘tively small. But even within this number, there was
sufficient variety of opinion to illustrate the diversities of
medieval theology. One bishop, Nacchianti of Chioggia, even
believed that all things necessary to salvation are contained.
in Scripture, and protested his right to continue to believe
this until the Council declared otherwise. The bishops of.
‘Trent, in framing their decrees, needed to allow a breadth,
which men of diverse opinions could accept as the authentic
teaching of the Catholic Church, The decrees of Trent were
‘framed with care; their language was designed to allow
more liberty of opinion than their Protestant critics
believed. The care with which they were framed has only
been fully evident during the twentieth century. During the
last fifty years the Gérres Society has been engaged in
publishing the minutes of the debates and discussions
which lay behind the formal promulgation of the canons,
One example will suffice: the decree of 8 April 1546 upon
the canonical Scriptures. Later critics of the Council
contended that this decree elevated tradition into a second.
source of revelation, outside and independent of Scripture:
an unwritten word spoken by Christ to his apostles and
guaranteed by its acceptance in the Catholic Church.
Many defenders of the Counter-Reformation understood
the decree in this way. But the minutes of the discussion
show that, if the decree is patient of that interpretation,
it was not intended by all the disputants. Some bishops
would have liked all the ‘traditions’ of the Holy Roman}
Church to be declared sacred. Other bishops felt that
this was too generalized; that the only traditions which}
could claim this sacredness were ‘apostolic’ traditions,
traditions handed down in the Church from apostolic times.
Tt was suggested that a list of apostolic traditions might be
framed in the canon; and this was rejected on the ground
that a list might unwittingly omit an apostolic tradition and
thereby cause. Christians.to neglect or repudiate it. The
clause was therefore framed to sanctify only traditions
‘which have always been maintained in the Catholic
Church’ ; and it is clear that some. of those who framed it
were thinking not of an unwritten heritage of doctrine but
of certain practices, like the keeping of Sunday or the
baptism of infants. Though the decree was intentionally
directed against. certain beliefs of Protestants, it .was less
hostile to the Protestant doctrines. than was afterwards
believed. And the same measure of diversity may be found
among other decrees, even those on the eucharistic sacrifice
or justification by faith,

Yet it is certain that the immediate effect was calamitous
for the programme of the peace-makers.

In October and November 1551, after a period when
Pope and Emperor were in. vehement conflict, Lutheran.
representatives at last arrived at Trent to prepare the way
for their theologians. They refused, to participate in the
Council unless. the bishops would begin to discuss the
questions of doctrine again from the beginning and regard
as null all the decisions which had. been. taken. Understandably ; and it is equally understandable that the papal
legates and the bishops should have rejected the suggestion
with warmth. By the word Council, the two sides meant
different assemblies. One assembly at Trent could not serve
for both.

The Council was not under the immediate control of the
Pope, who never came to it. His legates presided and
teceived frequent communications and instructions from.
the Curia at Rome, just as the representatives of the
Emperor or the kings of France and Spain received frequent
instructions from their respective sovereigns. The majority
in the Council was Italian; but as the number of bishops
tose (in the last session of 1562-3 it was over 200) the
successive Popes needed to exercise vigilant diplomacy
through agents at Trent. It was important to the Popes that
the Council should not be swayed by the political desires of

It was not difficult to assert that the clergy must be educated
and must preach sermons. It was more difficult, and took
far’ more time, to secure that the sermons which they
preached were not offensive to instructed ears. It was easy
to'legislate that a seminary should be instituted in every
diocese. It was long years before there were seminaries in
most dioceses and before many of those seminaries were
purveying an education worthy of the ideal which inspired
their foundation. It is possible that in the Protestant countries the problem of ministerial education was made easier
to solve because the revolutionary changes in the ecclesiastical constitution gave the authorities a hand less tied, and
also allowed a somewhat larger proportion of endowment to
be diverted into education. But in Protestant as in Catholic
countries a long age of endeavour was needed.

In the Protestant countries the reform was often carried
through by the princes against the Pope. In the Catholic
countries the process was not so different — it was carried
through by the ecclesiastics with the active or reluctant
assistance of the princes. In Catholic France and parts of
south Germany the decrees could not even be received, and
Spain helped itself to what it preferred. It was not easy to
reform the episcopate when so many Catholic kings,
including those of France and Spain, exercised an almost absolute
control over the choice of men to be bishops. As late as
June 1569, the Venetian ambassador in Paris said that at |
the French court ‘they deal in bishoprics and abbeys as
merchants trade in pepper and cinnamon’, The Council
of Trent was an effective reforming council mainly in Italy;
elsewhere it was an encouragement and stimulus to reform.
The decrees were accepted by some French provincial
councils in 1580-4, and solemnly in 1615 by the representa
tives of all the French clergy, at a brief moment of independent
assertion. Spanish councils of clergy consented to them
forthwith (1564) but could not put them into practice
without leave from the crown. In south Germany, thanks
to the skill of the:papal legate Commendone, the bishops
and Catholic princes (except the Emperor) received: the
decrees of Trent in 1566, though with a few reservations. c 3

## POPE PIUS V

The reforming party in the Church was helped to overcome
the conservative traditions of Rome by the new ‘political
predicament of the Pope. Considered as a political sovereign, the Pope was less important to the European powers
in 1565 than in 1510. In 1510 Julius II made the Papal
State one:of the powers of Europe, maintaining the political
balance between France and Germany and so

papal independence and sovereignty. In-1565 all this was
changed. The Pope was much poorer, for Germany’ and
England had defected, France was fighting a civil war, and
fees and dues were not paid. The Spanish Cardinal of
Compostella wrote with a cool cynicism»to the Emperor
Charles V in 1555 that the Pope must reform the Church,
because he was now too poor to do anything else. The rules
of the Council of Trent hampered traditional and lucrative
sources of profit, and made the Papal State a less happy
ground for adventurers ready to be ordained in re
for a fortune. Then Pope Paul IV (Caraffa) attacked 'the
Spanish in Naples with his armies, was defeated, and
threw the Papacy under the dominance of Spain for forty
years.

In 1565 Michele Ghislieri, the Grand Inquisitor of Pope
Paul IV (though no disciple or favourite), was elected Pope
and became Pius V (1565-72, canonized in 1712). A holier
man than Paul, he looked upon reform with a similar
contempt for compromise, politics, and diplomacy. He was
another ascetic with a decisive mind, a body which made
him look nothing but skin and bones, and away of life
which was still that of a strict friar. He once said that the
Church had need neither of cannon nor of soldiers, that its
weapons were prayers and fasting, tears and the Bible, But
he was prepared to use other weapons: than the spiritual
when: they were available. He encouraged the killing of
Huguenot prisoners, He sent the consecrated hat and sword
to the Duke of Alva to show his gratitude for the reign of
terror in the Netherlands.

Edicts imposed savage penalties for simony, blasphemy, 
sodomy, concubinage. They limited luxury in dress or in
banquets, expensive marriages or marriage settlements.
They expelled all the prostitutes from Rome within six
days, unless they would marry or enter the convent of the
Penitents — a decree which was not carried out in its full
rigour, but those who preferred not to brave the perils of
flight were confined to a special quarter, which was walled
in and: where special sermons were arranged for their
instruction. Another edict forbade all residents with houses
to visit taverns. The Pope was narrowly dissuaded from
imposing the” death penalty for adultery. Parents were
subjected to special penalties if they failed to send their
children to Sunday schools, Priests, who had commonly
dressed like laymen, were compelled to wear clerical dress
and to shave off their beards. Physicians and doctors were
forbidden to wear the biretta. Doctors were not to visit the
sick for more than three days without receiving a certificate
that the patient had confessed to a priest, The Pope tried
to restrain, the luxury of banquets, of weddings, and of
dress; his police raided jewellers’ shops to confiscate the
world’s baubles; his taxes discouraged carriages; his
decrees limited dowries and forbade shopkeepers to hang
out signboards with saints painted upon them, He thought
itunfitting that pagan images should decorate his residence,
and gave a few of the classical statues to the Roman people.
He wanted to give away many more, including some of the
great statues housed in the gallery of the Belvedere, and

allowed them to remain only on condition that the collec~
tion should not be open. to the public. He approved of the
covering of the statue of Neptune on the fountain at

Bologna and hired an artist to clothe more of the frescoes,
though in’ general he did not further drape the nudes.
Gossips began to say that Pope Pius wanted to change the’
whole city of Rome into a monastery. :

Sumptuary legislation of this sort was impossible’ to”
enforce effectively in the Rome'of 1570. Outside the power”
of the papal government it was altogether ineffective. The
Pope published a decree abolishing bull-fights, but the
Spanish bishops dared not publish it. These’ sumptuary
laws were more important as a symbol ofa programme and!
an ideal than as/a practical venture in moral government.
In the realm of administration the Pope ran into those
obstacles which had frustrated the reforming efforts of his
predecessors. The Pope once professed that the Church —
needed no wealth. In fact, Rome contained a great’ civil
service, a network of administration, and the papal govern-) _
ment could not be carried on without money. Offices had _
been sold for money; and in moments of imminent bank-"
tuptey, popes had created more offices, with incomes
attached, in order to find capital. To clear out the hangerson, the corrupt and petty officials from the papal court,
was not only an’ act of administrative reform. It meant
finding huge sums of money to compensate persons who
had bought offices in good faith and would now find their
offices and their income abolished. Pope Pius told some
officials dismissed from the Penitentiary that ‘it is always’
better to die of hunger than to lose one’s soul’. He said that
it was preferable for the Curia to be ruined rather than’
Christianity. But common justice could not sweep away the
bureaucrats of Rome without making provision for them,
He tried to force every priest and bishop who had a cure
of souls outside Rome to go back to his benefice, and even
imprisoned in the Castle of Sant’Angelo some bishops who
failed to obey the order. It was an attempt to cure the
symptom rather than the disease. Yet it was much for the
future that a Pope should have attempted so fearless a
reformation of the Papal administration. ‘Men in Rome,’
said the Venetian ambassador Tiepolo, ‘have become a
great deal better-or at least they have put on the 
appearance of being so.’

In 1568 the Pope reformed the Breviary. He adopted
. some of that programme which Cranmer had wanted
earlier — making it clearer and simpler, restoring the
Psalms and the reading of the Bible. to: their dominant
place, removing passages from the non-Scriptural readings
that were spurious or incredible. He restrained the issue of
indulgences; and in every way he attempted to carry into
Ptactice the decrees and the spirit of the Council of Trent.
In St Maria Maggiore in Rome may be seen the copy of the
decrees of Trent which Pope Pius V used. The historian
Pastor looked upon that little book with deep emotion, and
commented: ‘It became in his hands the hoe by which he
uprooted a whole world of weeds.’

### Charles Borromeo

‘The strength of the movement at its best is seen in the work
of Charles, Borromeo, Archbishop of Milan from 1560 to:
1584. He experienced one of those colourful conversions so
exuberantly plentiful in. the Counter-Reformation. The
nephew of Pope Pius IV, a beneficed clergyman at the age

‘twelve, a pluralist and an archbishop at the uncanonical
age of twenty-one, a cardinal at twenty-two, a devotee of
hunting in a manner criticized as unfitting for a cardinal, a
lover of splendour and display who clothed his 150 retainers
_ from head to foot in a livery of black velvet, he suddenly
received holy orders atthe age of twenty-five, undertook the
Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius, tried to resign most of his
lucrative sinecure benefices, dismissed half his retinue and
prescribed austere rules for the other half, lived on bread
and water one day a week, used a scourge of spikes upon his
body, and, began to preach sermons — which the people
thought striking, for they had never heard of a cardinal
preaching. His abilities and his standing at Rome enabled
him to play a large part in the last session of the Council of
Trent (1562-3). The Council created a commission to
ensure that its decrees were observed, and another commission to draw up a revised catechism in Catholic’ doctrines)
Borromeo helped to direct the work of both these commis-_
sions and revised the first draft.of the catechism, Itiis)
characteristic of the Counter-Reformation that this famous:
catechism should have been’ designed not for the child-or,
the illiterate, but for the instruction of the parochial clergy.
He helped to revise the Breviary, as Trent had decreed. He>
attempted to carry out in his archdiocese the disciplinary.
decrees of Trent. Trent had ordered him to reside in his.
diocese, but he had the greatest difficulty in persuading the:
Pope to allow him even to visit it. He succeeded in persuad-.
ing Pope Pius V and lived at. Milan, the first archbishop to:
reside in the diocese for many years. He held provincial
and diocesan synods of his clergy as Trent had ordered.
He was the new model of a Catholic bishop, constantly
engaged in visiting his parishes. He established not one!
seminary but three in'Milan and three more outside it. He’
put these at first under the control of the Jesuits, but later
} lost his confidence in the Jesuits and founded a, teaching)
society, the Oblates of St Ambrose, for the purpose. /He
founded a ‘Swiss college’ to train priests for Catholic Swit-;
zerland, He instituted an educational society which by the,
time of his death was controlling 740 schools. He was.a
| grimly austere, often unpopular, heroic man, ready to risk;
life in a plague or his comfort in a fight with the governor.
He died in 1584 and was canonized in 1610,

## THE ENGLISH REGUSANTS
    
Every state which became Protestant lost, churchmen by’
flight or banishment. A small number were not reconciled
to change and preferred to maintain their traditional
worship in other lands. These men were not attracted by the
| whitewash and the destruction or by seeing vestments,
Pyxes, images, copes, altars and. censers being sold on the
open market.
