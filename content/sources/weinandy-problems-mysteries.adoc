## Chapter 2: Theology--Problems and Mysteries

To take up the topic of God's impassibility is to address not simply the
mystery of God in himself, but also, and maybe even more so, his
relationship to the created order, especially his relationship with human
persons and their history. As is clearly evident from the previous
chapter, it is a theological issue that is not only on the minds of
theologians, but also in the hearts of many Christian faithful.

Before we begin to examine the question of God's impassibility it is, I
believe, imperative that I first articulate what I consider the precise
nature of the theological enterprise, for this will govern my whole
approach to the issue at hand. The questions are: What is the theologian
attempting to achieve when he or she does theology? More specifically,
what is the Christian theologian hoping to achieve when he or she is
pondering, in the light of reason, the revealed truths of the gospel and the
received tradition and doctrines of the Christian faith? In the present
case, when we wish to examine whether God is passible or impassible
and the impact that the alternatives have on God's relationship to the
created order, to human history, and to individual human beings, what
is it that we are theologically trying to accomplish? Moreover, what
attitude of faith should we possess and what theological disposition
should we embrace in pursuing this topic?
footnote:[For a different, but very compatible, approach to the one that I will present here on the ' nature of theology and the craft of the systematic theologian, see R.W. Jenson's : excellent preparative chapters to his Systematic Theology, Volume 1: The Triune God : (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997), pp. 3-41. For other fine introductory essays on the same subjects, see C. Gunton, 'Historical and Systematic Theology,' pp. 3-20; G.  Loughlin, The Basis and Authority of Doctrine, pp. 41~64; and F. Watson, 'The Scope ; of Hermeneutics,' pp. 65-80, all in The Cambridge Companion to Christian Doctrine, ed. C.  : Gunton (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1997); and J. Webster, Theological : Theology: An Inaugural Lecture (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1998).]
In this chapter I will address these issues.

### Theology and the Development of Doctrine

I want first to articulate briefly some of the ingredients that foster and
encourage the theological enterprise, and so help define the task of the
theologian. Moreover, in so doing we will also see more clearly how this
study of God's impassibility is theologically situated.

First, inherent within the very nature of Christian revelation is the
principle that faith seeks understanding.
footnote:[St Augustine was the first to articulate this principle. He wrote 'Understanding is the
reward of faith. Therefore do not seek to understand in order to believe, but believe that
you may understand.' Tractatus in Joannis Evangelium, 29,6. He also wrote: 'For although
no one can believe in God unless he understands something, nonetheless the faith by
which he believes, heals him, so that he may understand more fully. For there are some
things which we believe only if we understand and other things which we understand
only if we believe.' Enarrationes in Psalmos, 119. (Unless otherwise stated all translations
of the works of the Fathers in this book are taken from The Artte-Nicene/Nicene and PostNicene Fathers, ed. P, Schaff, reprinted by T & T Clark and Eerdmans, 1989.) Also see,
Augustine's sermon on Isaiah 7:9 and De Trinitate, 1,1~2 and 5,2,2, St Anselm articulated the principle more succinctly. 'For I do not seek to understand in order to believe
but [ believe in order to understand. For I believe even this: that I shall not understand
unless I believe.' Proslagion, 1.]
Precisely because rational persons are the beneficiaries of this revelation, they are eager, impelled
by the Spirit of truth, to deepen their understanding of what they believe.
Such searching and querying is a sign, not of a lack of faith, but of an
authentic spiritual vibrancy. Thus, it is characteristic of believers to wish
to grow, for example, in their understanding of what it means for Jesus
to be the Son of God or to discern more deeply the importance of his
resurrection. Christian theology cultivates this growth in the understanding of revelation, and so discloses its deeper significance.

Christian theologians, their reason guided by faith and the light of the
Holy Spirit, clarify and advance what has been revealed by God, written
in the scriptures, and believed by their fellow Christians. In so doing
Christian theologians wish to make what has been revealed more
intelligible, lucid, and relevant to the Christian community. This present study
exemplifies that Christian theologians and the Christian body at large are
presently searching, in faith, for a clearer perception of the nature of God
and his attributes, specifically whether or not reason and revelation
demand that God be impassible or passible - 'Does God Suffer?'
footnote:[I hope that this doctrinal and systematic study will, insomesmall way, faithfully actualize
Pope John Paul II's grand vision of the true and fruitful relationship between faith and
reason, that is, of faith seeking understanding, See the whole of his Fides et Ratio (1998).
For its part, dogmatic theology must be able to articulate the universal meanings of
the mystery of the One and Triune God and of the economy of salvation, both as
a narrative and, above all, in the form of argument. It must do so, in other words,
through concepts formulated in a critical and universally communicable way.
Without philosophy's contribution, it would in fact be impossible to discuss theological issues such as, for example, the use of language to speak about God, the
personal relations within the Trinity, God's creative activity in the world, the
relationship between God and man, or Christ's identity as true God and true man.
Thid., n. 66
'The question of God's impassibility demands that all of the above examples given
by John Paul be examined, in the light of faith and philosophy, during the course of this
study.]

Second, Christian theology also wishes to defend, by reasoned
argument, what has been revealed against those who question, distort, or
attack it. However, not all questioning and dissent are in bad faith.
Today, for example, many Christians, theologians and faithful alike,
argue and believe that revelation and reason necessitate that God be
passible and so suffer. I am not of that mind, but it is precisely this
climate of controversy that has compelled me and others to address
newly the nature of God in the light of these contemporary issues.

This relationship between controversy and growth should not
surprise us. The principle that faith seeks understanding is often,
historically, most clearly observed when theologians were forced to clarify the
truths of faith, not simply for the edification of believers, but in order to
protect and demonstrate the reasonableness of what had traditionally
been believed. In the fourth century it was in the midst of defending the
divinity of the Son and of the Holy Spirit that the church came to a new
clarity about the Trinity. Theological controversy by its very nature
forces theologians and the church to address pressing questions, and so
reasonably to justify anew what has been revealed. This fresh theological
clarity will, it is hoped, lead all believers to a deeper and more committed
faith, and aid those who find it difficult to believe.

Third, Christian theology also wishes to demonstrate the inter-relationship
between the various truths of faith. This too clarifies and
expands the understanding of the truths related. For example, in clarifying
the relationship between the Father and Jesus one not only acquires
a better understanding of their relationship, but also what it means for
the Father to be the Father and the Son to be the Son. In this study, issues
concerning the nature of God and his impassibility must be related to the
notion of creation, to the manner of God's presence and activity in the
world and in human history, and to the salvation that comes through
Jesus. Our study of the inter-relationship between all of these topics will
shed light on them both individually and collectively.

Fourth, the work of individual theologians is not done in isolation.
Theologians work within an historical context and within the Christian
community. Clarity and understanding grow within the history of the
Christian church and within the context of the community of believers.
What may come to greater clarity in one historical era will differ from
what becomes clearer in another. Again, for example, the early church
experienced a growth in understanding with regards to the Incarnation
and the Trinity. During the Reformation the church's recognition of the
nature and importance of faith and justification increased.

This does not mean that these issues were never addressed previously
nor does it imply that they will cease to be addressed in the future, as if
all has now been concluded. Rather, this only specifies that certain key
theological questions or issues were raised and certain important
communal concerns for the church were addressed at specific times, and
that through this historical and communal process, with the help of
theologians and church authorities, a new clarity was achieved.

This study concerning the impassibility of God exemplifies a concern
that is presently challenging Christian theologians of all denominations
and their respective communities. The issues have been discussed, as we
will see, in the past, but today they have come to the fore with new
intensity arising out of contemporary concerns, and so innovative
arguments and fresh clarity are demanded in our day.

Fifth, personal prayer and communal worship likewise foster theological
understanding. Liturgy is a living expression of what is believed,
and so through participation in it one grows in an understanding of the
faith. Historically, liturgy at times expressed an intuitive apprehension of
the faith that actually preceded and exceeded the later explicit
intellectual exposition. For example, the baptismal formula and the doxologies
clearly expressed the church's belief that the Father, the Son, and the
Holy Spirit were all equally God. When some in the early church
doubted or denied that the Holy Spirit was God equal to the Father and
the Son, one of the principal arguments on behalf of the Spirit's divinity
was the church's ancient liturgical practise.
footnote:[See, for example, Basil the Great's treatise On the Holy Spirit where he argues for the divinity of the Holy Spirit from the church's doxological practise]
Here we not only see that
liturgical prayer and practise fostered the faith, but also that it later
became a primary source for theological reflection and argument. This
illustrates the well-known formula: lex orandi, lex credendi (the law of
prayer is the law of belief) ~ as the church prays, so the church believes.

Prayer and liturgical practise embody and express then the Christian
understanding of God, his attributes and his relationship to believers.
Thus the question of God's impassibility must be examined in the light
of how Christians pray and how the church worships. Does Christian
prayer and worship entail and manifest belief in God's impassibility or
passibility?

All of these various ingredients, which advance the growth of theological
understanding, contribute then, to what John Henry Newman
was first to call, the development of doctrine.
footnote:[See John Henry Newman, Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1974)]
The Christian community's understanding of the truths of revelation grows and
develops. These components, which make up the theological enterprise
of the entire church body, testify that the knowledge of faith is not static.
Faith, in constantly seeking to be more deeply understood and ardently
lived, by different Christians at different times and in different cultures,
evolves. As the Christian church progresses through history and
confronts, thoughtfully and prayerfully, the problems and issues of its
particular time, its understanding of what God has revealed develops
and matures. The question of God's impassibility and all its theological,
spiritual, and practical ramifications is presently a case in point.

### Problems and Mysteries

Having briefly enunciated some of the ingredients which cultivate
theological understanding and doctrinal growth, it is now important to
examine how theologians, in the light of these elements, should approach
and foster such understanding and development. What is it that the
theologian does, as a believer seeking understanding within the historical
and communal setting, to help bring about new theological focus and
advance authentic development? It is here that I believe there is a great
deal of confusion among theologians, and the issue of God's impassibility
illustrates this confusion.

Gabriel Marcel, in his Gifford Lectures of 1949 and 1950, and iater
Jacques Maritain, who borrowed the distinction from Marcel, spoke of two
contrasting attitudes a person may possess when approaching questions.
Marcel pointed out that we can approach a field of inquiry as either a
problem or as a _mystery_.
footnote:[See Gabriel Marcel, The Mystery of Being, I, Reflection and Mystery (London: The Harvill Press, 1950), pp. 204-19.]
He was critical of the modern mentality which
approached every intellectual endeavor under the rubric of problem, that
is, as if one were always examining some detached state of affairs which
could be coldly dissected and systematically analyzed so as to produce
complete and comprehensive knowledge. This was being done, he
believed, not only within the natural sciences, where it may be legitimate,
butalso within the humanities, specifically within his own discipline—that
of philosophy.
footnote:[Jacques Maritain states: 'The problem aspect naturally predominates where knowledge
is Jeast ontological, for example, when it is primarily concerned with mental construc
tions built around a sensible datum ~ as in empirical knowledge, and in the sciences of
phenomena.' A Prefice to Metaphysics (London: Sheed & Ward, 1939), p. 6.]
Marcel argued that some fields of human enquiry cannot
be properly understood, and in actual fact they become distorted, when
approached as problems. Rather, they must be approached under the
rubric of _mystery_, which 'by definition, transcends every conceivable
technique.
footnote:[Marcel, _The Mystery of Being_, I, p. 211.]
Human beings are, for Marcel, a mystery and the fundamental concerns of
human beings are mysteries — personhood, identity,
friendship, family, good and evil, etc. By mystery then Marcel meant that
while one could say a great deal about human beings and the central issues
that surround them, yet no matter how much one said and no matter how
true it may be, there is always more to be understood and articulated.
There is no comprehensive, complete, and final answer. We may come to
a greater understanding of the mystery of human life, but we never come
to a complete comprehension of it. Maritain states that where there is
mystery 'the intellect has to penetrate more and more deeply the same
object.
footnote:[Maritain, _A Preface to Metaphysics_, p. 7. Maritain also states:
Where the problem aspect prevails one solution follows another; where one ends,
the other begins. There is a rectilinear progress of successive views .... Where the
problem aspect predominates I thirst to know the answer to my problem. And
when I have obtained the answer | am satisfied: that particular thirst is quenched.
.. In the second case where the mystery aspect predominates I thirst to know
reality, being under one or other of its modes, the ontological mystery. When I
know it [ drink my fill. But [ still thirst and continue to thirst for the same thing,
the same reality which at once satisfies and increases my desire. Thus I never cease
quenching my thirst from the same spring of water which is ever fresh and yet I
always thirst for it. A Preface to Metaphysics, pp. 7-8.
For Maritain God is the fundamental mystery, and our thirst can only be satiated
when we see him face to face. See ibid, pp. 5 and 8-9.]

The mystery, by the necessity of its subject matter, remains.

While Marcel and Maritain were primarily concerned with distinguishing
the problems of scientific enquiry from the mysteries of
philosophic enquiry, I believe that such a distinction between problem
and mystery is relevant to how theologians ought to approach issues of
faith and theology.

Marcel and Maritain were well aware that, arising out of the
Enlightenment, there grew the mentality that intellectual advancement
consisted in solving problems that had hitherto not been solved. The
former 'mysteries' of the physical universe were being resolved by
approaching them as scientific problems to be decoded and unraveled.
The scientific and physical laws of nature became transparent and
unmistakable. The new enthusiasm and success of the scientific method
was the major contributing factor to this mentality. Science became the
means of resolving all kinds of problems and issues concerning nature
and how nature worked. All this was done in a concise, rational,
mathematical, and experiential fashion. It was equally eminently practical.
Scientific knowledge could solve a host of practical problems, and
everyone gloried in its success. This mentality is illustrated in the
contemporary belief that technology, one of the fruits of science, can
solve almost any problem. In the realm of science and technology this
mentality, that intellectual advancement consists in solving theoretical
and practical problems, may be legitimate.'
footnote:[However, even in the field of science there remains a sense of 'mystery' and, I believe,
many scientists are coming to this awareness. The more science unlocks the 'mysteries'
of the universe, the more mysterious it becomes. New knowledge always leads to new
and baffling questions. Science may solve problems, but its solutions often create even
greater _mysteries_.]
However, I want to argue
that this mentality, to disastrous effect, has coloured how many
philosophers and theologians approach questions of faith and theology.

Many theologians today, having embraced the Enlightenment presuppositions and the scientific method that it fostered, approach theological
issues as if they were scientific problems to be solved rather than
mysteries to be discerned and clarified. However, the true goal of theological inquiry is not the resolution of theological problems, but the
discernment of what the mystery of faith is. Because God, who can never
be fully comprehended, lies at the heart of all theological enquiry,
theology by its nature is not a problem solving enterprise, but rather a
mystery discerning enterprise.

This can be seen already in the early stages of God's revelation of
himself to the Jewish people. God manifested himself to Moses in the
burning bush (see Exod. 3). Moses, in the course of the conversation,
asked God: 'What is your name?' Since names, for the Israelites, both
revealed the character of the person so named and allowed the knower
of the name to call upon the person so named, Moses, in asking God to
tell him his name, wanted to know God as well as have the power to call
upon him. Moses was attempting to solve, what was for him, a theological
problem. God must have chuckled
footnote:[It was, obviously(?), an 'impassible' chuckle!]
to himself as he replied to
Moses: 'I Am Who Any' or 'I Am He Who Is.'
footnote:[Scholars debate as to the exact translation of the name Yahweh, Scholars agree that it
comes from the Hebrew root word meaning 'to be.' Some translate it in the causative
sense of 'he causes to be,' but the more likely and traditional translation is 'I am who
arn' or 'Lam the one who exists,' or 'I am he who is.' For a concise treatment, see The
New Jerusalem Bible (London: Darton, Longman & Todd, 1985), Exodus 3:13 fn. g.]

God did reveal to Moses his name and so Moses now knew more
about God than he knew before, He now knew that God is 'He who is.'
However, Moses must have quickly realized that, in knowing God more
fully, God had become an even greater mystery (problem) than he was
before. Previously Moses in calling God, for example, El Shaddai - God of
the Mountain ~ may not have known a great deal about God, but the little
he did know was at least somewhat comprehensible. God was he who
dwelt on the mountain, which was the home of the gods. However,
Moses now knew much more about God. He actually knew that God is 'T
Am Who Am,' but what it means for God to be 'He Who Is' is completely
incomprehensible. Moses, nor we today, can comprehend that God's
very nature is 'to be,' that he is the one who is the fulness of life and
existence.

Here we learn a primary lesson concerning the nature of revelation
and theology. The more God reveals who he is and the more we come to
a true and authentic knowledge of who he is, the more mysterious he
becomes. Theology, as faith seeking understanding, helps us come to a
deeper and fuller understanding of the nature of God and his revelation,
but this growth is in coming to know what the mystery of God is and not
the comprehension of the mystery.
footnote:[Christians believe that Jesus revealed God to be a trinity of
persons - the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit. Christians now know more about God than did Moses, but in
coming to a greater knowledge of God, God has become even more mysterious than he
was for Moses.]

### Examples from the History of Theology

Let me further illustrate the difference between approaching questions of
revelation as problems to be solved rather than as mysteries to be
clarified by examining a couple of theological controversies that arose
within the early church.

In the early fourth century, Arius, a priest in Alexandria, took up the
issue of how God could be one and how simultaneously the Son could be
God. This is an authentic theological concern, and one that had been
percolating in the early church for a long time. Arius, having examined
all of the previous attempts at explaining this 'problem' concluded that
there was no way to resolve the issue rationally. If God was one, then the
Son, Arius concluded, could not possibly be God and, therefore, he must
be a creature. Arius resolved the 'problem' of how God could
simultaneously be one and the Son be God by denying one of the truths that
the church had previously held, that is, the divinity of the Son. Arius
provided an answer. It was very clear and understandable. The problem
was solved. However, in solving this theological 'problem' Arius also
dissolved the faith of the church which believed that not only was the
Father God but also equally the Son.

In response to Arius, the church held its first ecumenical council at
Nicea in 325. The majority of the church Fathers probably did not know
how to answer fully or satisfactorily Arius' arguments, but they did
know what the church believed, and so proclaimed that Jesus is God as
the Father is God and that he was homoousion (one in being) with the
Father.

It was Athanasius, in the ensuing controversy after the council, who
grasped the real significance of Nicea's homoousion doctrine, Athanasius
reconceived what it meant for God to be one. Where in the past all
Christian theologians conceived the one God to be the Father (this understanding included Arius), and then attempted to show how the Son
shared in the one nature of God, an attempt that Arius realized was
doomed to failure, Athanasius recognized that Christian revelation
completely shattered this view of God. Athanasius' great insight was to
perceive that the one God is not just the Father, but rather that the one
God is the Father begetting the Son. This is the very nature of the one
God. This is what God is. What the one nature of God is is the Father
eternally begetting the Son. Therefore, the Father and Son are the one
God, one in being, for the one God is the dynamic inter-relationship
between Father and the Son.

Athanasius approached the issue of how God can be one and the Son
be God not as a problem to be solved, but as a mystery to be discerned.
With Arius all becomes comprehensible. With Athanasius a new clarity
is achieved as to what the mystery is, but the mystery itself does not
become completely comprehensible. We know more precisely and
clearly what the mystery is, that is, that the one God is the Father
begetting the Son, but we do not comprehend the mystery, that is, we do
not fully grasp how the one being/nature of God is the Father eternally
begetting the Son. That remains a mystery and has become, in a sense,
even more a mystery, but one that has obtained new depth of clarity.
footnote:[One could also cite the example found in the fifth century with regards to the
incarnation. The Council of Nicea had proclaimed the full divinity of the Son, and
equally the church later condemned Apollinarius for denying the full humanity of
Jesus. There then arose, with greater intensity, the question of how the one Jesus could
be both fully God and fully man. Nestorius upheld the full divinity and the full
humanity. The problem for him was how to conceive of them as one without jeopardizing either the humanity or the divinity. He rightly argued that some in the past, for
example Apollinarius, in order to make Jesus one denied the full humanity of Jesus.
Apollinarius denied the human soul of Jesus, and thus the divinity was united to the
body alone so as to form the one reality of Jesus, after the manner of the human soul
and body forming the one reality of man. Apollinarius had resolved the problem of
Jesus' oneness by denying the full humanity. Nestorius knew that this was erroneous.
The incarnation demanded the fulness of divinity and the fulness of the humanity.
However, Nestorius himself solved the problem by ultimately denying the ontological
union between the humanity and the divinity, that is, that Jesus is really one. The
divinity and the humanity were only united by a moral union, that is, the Son assumed
the humanity in love or by 'good pleasure.' Nestorius proposed this because he could
not conceive how God and man could be truly one without destroying either the
divinity or the humanity. Nestorius solved the theological problem, but again he
equally dissolved the mystery. The mystery of the Incarnation is that the Son of God, in
the fulness of his divinity, did actually, come to exist as a full man.
Cyril of Alexandria, Nestorius' arch-opponent, who himself had some of his own
theological ambiguities, nonetheless realized that the Son of God did actually become
man. He began to discern, what the Council of Chalcedon in 451 would later affirm, that
the Incarnation is not the union of natures, which would demand that either or both the
humanity and the divinity be transformed in the process and so produce some third
kind of being which was neither God nor man, but rather that in the Incarnation it is
the person of the Son who takes on an entirely new mode of existence. He comes to exist
as man. Thus Jesus is the one person of the Son existing as God and as man. The Council
of Chalcedon declared that Jesus is one and the same Son existing as fully God and fully
man without destroying either the divinity or the humanity. Within the Incarnation the
identity of Jesus, who he is, is the eternal divine Son but the manner of the Son's
identity is as man. Again, Cyril and Chalcedon did not solve a theological problem.
What they did was clarify the mystery of the Incarnation. We now know more clearly
that the mystery of the Incarnation is that the one person of the eternal Son actually
exists as a complete man, but we do not comprehend the mystery. That remains, and is,
in a sense again, even more mysterious.
For a fuller account of the controversies surrounding Arius, Apollinarius and
Nestorius see A. Grillmeier, Christ in Christian Tradition, Vol. 1 (London: Mowbrays,
1975); J.N.D. Kelly, Early Christian Doctrines (London: Adam & Charles Black, 1968),
chapters 4-6, 9-12; B, Studer, Trinity and Incarnation (Collegeville: The Liturgical Press,
1993); J. Pelikan, The Christian Tradition: A History of the Development of Doctrine 1: The
Emergence of the Catholic Tradition (100-600) (Chicago: University Press of Chicago,
1971), chapters 4-5; and T. Weinandy, Does God Change?, chapters 1-2.]

An example of a more contemporary nature may be also helpful.
Kenotic christologists ask the question: How can a God who is almighty,
all-knowing, and all-powerful become man, and so take on human
limitations--weakness, lack of knowledge, etc.? It would appear that we are
faced, within the Incarnation, with contrary and irreconcilable attributes.
Kenotic christology, both past and present, solves the problem by having
the Son of God either give up (empty himself--_kenosis_) those divine
attributes which would be incompatible with his human limitations, or
holding them in abeyance or restraint. The problem is solved. However,
again the mystery is also equally dissolved. No longer is the Son of God,
in the fulness of his divinity, existing as man. Rather, a truncated and
lesser 'humanized' form of divinity now exists as man. Kenotic christology
always proposes that someone less than fully Ged exists as man
and not that God, in all his wholly otherness, exists as man.

Kenotic christology misconceives the nature of the Incarnation. It is
not a union of incompatible natures with the ensuing conflict of incompatibie
attributes. Rather, within the Incarnation the person of the eternal
Son, while remaining fully divine, takes on a new life as man, and so
assumes a fully human life in all its human frailty and weakness. The
mystery is that one and the same person or subject, who actually is
all-powerful as God, is equally weak and frail as man, for it is in that manner
that the same Son now also exists,'footnote:[
For a further examination of kenotic christology and its refutation see T. Weinandy,
Does God Change?, chapter 4, and In the Likeness of Sinful Flesh: An Essay on the Humanity
of Christ (Edinburgh: T & T Clark, 1993), pp. 8-13.]

### The Contemporary Theological Mindset

Examples of how theologians have treated theological questions as either
problems to be solved or mysteries to be clarified could be multiplied
throughout the history of theology. Hopefully, the above examples make
it evident that true Christian theology has to do with clarifying, and so
developing, the understanding of the mysteries of faith and not the
dissolving of the mysteries into complete comprehension. The point
at issue here is that this distinction between solving problems and
elucidating mysteries has, since the Enlightenment, become almost
completely lost within theology. While multiple examples again could be
given to illustrate this, the question of God's impassibility is the subject
of this book, and itself well exemplifies the point.

As we saw in the first chapter, many theologians argue that God's
impassibility, as traditionally believed by Christians through the
centuries, cannot be compatible with his being a loving person who cares
for and interacts with human beings within time and history. Thus, they
deny that God is impassible, and instead assert that he must be passible,
and so suffers. Again, the problem is solved, but is it solved at the
expense of maintaining the great mystery of God and of his relationship
to the world and human beings? An affirmative answer to this question
will be given in the course of this study. However, this study will not
solve this theological problem. This study only hopes to clarify the mystery
of God's impassibility in relationship to the passible lives of human
beings within the ever-changing world of history. In so doing the
mystery, it is hoped, will come into sharper focus and so become more
deeply known and appreciated, but it will not become comprehensible.
As Pope John Paul II has stated: 'In short, the knowledge proper to faith
does not destroy the mystery; it only reveals it the more, showing how
necessary it is for people's lives.'!
footnote:[Fides et Ratio, n. 13.]

### Openness to Further Development

Before concluding this chapter, I would like to make two final points.
Firstly, it should be noted, as alluded to above, that when theological
issues are treated as problems to be solved, once the seeming solution has
been found, usually by denying one of terms of the problem, the issue
becomes completely closed. The problem is solved. The complete answer
has been given. There is no longer any further need for clarification or
development. One can move on to the next problem.

This is not the case with true theological and doctrinal development.
While the mystery has been clarified, it has not become fully comprehensible, and so it remains open to further clarification and development.
The depth of the mystery can still be plunged further. True development
is an impetus to further development.
footnote:[This is one of the most insightful points that Cardinal Newman makes in his Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine.]

The reason for the open-ended nature of true theological and doctrinal
development is that we are ultimately engaged with the mystery of God
in himself and with his actions in time and history. God, in himself, is
incomprehensible, and thus his relationship to the created order and his
actions within that order throughout history and in the lives of human
beings can never be fully comprehended.
footnote:[This is the point Maritain makes, see n. 8 above.]
We can come to know who
the mystery of God is, and we can come to know the mysteries embodied.
in his dealings with human persons, but we will never be able to fully
comprehend him or his actions — not even in heaven. In heaven the
mystery of God will become crystal clear for we will see God face to face,
but in seeing him face to face the incomprehensibility of God will equally
become luminously evident.
footnote:[
This is in keeping with the writings of the great Christian mystics of the East and the
West who maintain that the more one grows in union with God, and so comes to know
him ever more intimately, the more incomprehensible he becomes. The mystics are
fond of such phrases as 'luminous darkness' and 'the rays of divine darkness.' Besides
the standard introductions and histories of eastern and western spirituality and
ysticism see also O. Clément, The Roots of Christian Mysticism (London: New City,
1993); and A. Louth, The Origins of the Christian Mystical Tradition (Oxford: Clarendon.
Press, 1981).]

It must be remembered too that our guiding principle that faith seeks
understanding does not mean that faith seeks comprehension. Precisely
because it is the faith — the mystery of God and all his words and deeds
~ that we are attempting to understand more fully, we will never be able
to comprehend it entirely. Faith by its very nature is 'the assurance of
things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen' (Heb. 11:1). Here 'we
see in a mirror dimly' (1 Cor. 13:12).

### The Compatibility of Truths

Second, as was briefly noted above, one of the primary reasons theological issues become problems is that two or more 'truths' are seen as
seemingly incompatible. God cannot be one and the Son be God. Jesus
cannot be both God and man. God cannot be impassible and yet loving.
Some would solve the problem, as we saw, by denying one of the truths.
This is often seen as the most rational way forward, but I believe it is the
all too easy way forward, and one that ultimately comes to a dead end.

Others, who seek less radical solutions to theological problems,
propose that such incompatible 'truths' must be held dialectically, that is,
that even though they are incompatible, yet both must nonetheless be
maintained. The opposition is between truths that are held together for
the sake of preserving 'the mystery.' Thus, for example, despite the fact
that God's impassiblity does conflict with his being loving, yet both must
be held because there is a 'mystery' present. I do not subscribe to, as will
become evident in this book, a dialectical approach to theological issues.
I believe that such a proposal still approaches theological issues as
problems or riddles, but now ones that cannot be solved.

To address the mysteries of faith as true mysteries is to clarify why
two or more seemingly incompatible truths are not incompatible, and
why they actually complement one another.
footnote:[I attempted to demonstrate this principle in my book Does God Change?.
There I argued that the immutability of God is not in opposition to the
Incarnation, but rather that only an immutable God can actually come to exist as man.]
Thus, this book wishes to demonstrate not that despite God's
impassibility he is nonetheless loving
and kind, but rather precisely because he is impassible that he is loving
and kind. I want to argue in this study that only an impassible God, and
not a passible God, is truly and fully personal, absolutely and utterly
loving, and thoroughly capable of interacting with human persons in
time and history.footnote:[
In this chapter I have attempted to describe the nature of the theological enterprise and
the work of Christian theologians in a manner that would be 'ecumenical,' that is, ina
manner that theologians of all Christian denominations might affirm; although I realize
that some, and maybe many, might not. Nonetheless, while I have made appeal to the
received Christian tradition, the early ecumenical councils, and to the church's teaching
authority, I, consciously, did not specifically mention doctrines and dogmas that would
be peculiar to specific Christian denominations. Nor did I specify any particular form
of ecclesial teaching authority other than the ancient councils. [t is this 'ecumenical'
understanding of the theological enterprise which will govern this work. However, in
honesty, | should say that, being a Roman Catholic, the tradition and magisterial
teaching of my own denomination has also guided my thinking from the onset of this
undertaking. While the common Christian tradition has, from the patristic age, upheld
the impassibility of God in himself, and therefore is obliged, Lbelieve, to continue to do
so, | also believe that I must do so in order to be faithful to the tradition and teaching
of the Roman Catholic Church. I do not think that such an obligation hi onstrained
either my freedom or my creativity as a theologian. Rather, it has forced me and freed
me to be more creative, as this book will hopefully demonstrate, than the vast multitude
of contemporary theologians who argue that God is passible.]
This is the great challenge of this study. This is the
awesome mystery that ultimately needs to be clarified and developed.
Whether this book meets this challenge, can be judged at the end.

### Definition of Terms

Before proceeding it would be helpful to define briefly the terms
'impassibility' and 'passibility.'
_The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church_ states:

> There are three respects in which orthodox theology has traditionally
denied God's subjection to 'passibility', namely (1) external passibility
or the capacity to be acted upon from ithout, (2) internal
passibility or the capacity for changing the emotions from within,
and (3) sensational passibility or the liability to feelings of pleasure
and pain caused by the action of another being?
footnote:[
The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, 3td edition edited by EA. Livingstone
(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997), p. 823. R. Creel discusses eight different, but
interconnected, understandings of what it means for God to be impassible which result
ina choice of sixteen permutations. While such a detailed discussion may be useful for
the sake of clarity, the clarity can easily become lost in the complexity. See Divine
Impassibility, pp. 3
ELP. Owen states that impassibility 'means particularly that he [God] cannot exp
ence sorrow, sadness ot pain' (Concepts of Deity, p. 23). M. Sarot defines impassibility as
'immutability with regard to one's feeling, or the quality of one's inner life.' 'Patripassianis
Theopaschitism and the Suffering of God: Some Historical and Systematic
Considerations, Religious Studies 26 (1990):368.
It should also be noted that divine impassibility is a logical consequence of divine
immutability. If God is ontologically unchangeable, then, by definition, he is equally
ontologically impassible, for to undergo inner emotional changes of state would render
him ontologically mutable.]

It is this understanding of impassibility that is employed throughout
this study, and it is this understanding of impassibility which I will be
defending. God is impassible in the sense that he cannot experience
emotional changes of state due to his relationship to and interaction with
human beings and the created order. This understanding of impassibility
does not imply, as this study will demonstrate, that God is not utterly
passionate in his love, mercy and compassion.

For God to be 'passible' then means that he is capable of being acted
upon from without and that such actions bring about emotional changes
of state within him. Moreover, for God to be passible means that he is
capable of freely changing his inner emotional state in response to and
interaction with the changing human condition and world order. Last,
passibility implies that God's changing emotional states involve
'feelings' that are analogous to human feelings. Thus one can speak, for
example, of God's inner emotional state as changing from joy to sorrow,
or from delight to suffering. It is this notion of passibility — that God
experiences inner emotional changes of state, either of comfort or
discomfort, whether freely from within or by being acted upon from
without ~ that will be denied in this study.
