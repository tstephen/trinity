## Background Factors/Events

1. The French Revolution (1789)
2. Romanticism: See works of Thomas Carlyle, Walter Scott and, in time, through the art of the Pre-raphaelites.
3. The Industrial Revolution:

## Religion and Politics: the age of Reform and Social Transformation

Repeal of the Corporation Act (1661) and Test Act (1673) - led to non-conformists and Roman
Catholics entering public life.

Abolition of the Slave Trade - 80% of national income. William Wilberforce led to abolition of Slave
Trade (1807) and in 1833 it became illegal to have a slave.

Tithes: the Church had the right to levy a 10% tithe on all agricultural produce. Source of local
income to the incumbent: varied from parish to parish. Wealthy livings meant incumbents could
appoint a team of curates to do the work for them.

Expansion of the cities: led to need for new parishes and new church buildings. Waterloo
churches: parliament funded church building in 1818 and 1824. Church-building continued apace
throughout the century.

## Tractarianism and Anglo-catholicism

### Early History: the Oxford Movement

Beginning dated to John Keble preaching his assize sermon at Oxford University in 1833 called, A
National Apostasy.

From the start, Anglo-Catholicism has been about the spiritual authority and vocation of the
Church of God, especially as applied to the Anglican Church.

Early Tractarians/Oxford Movement included:
- John Henry Newman
- Edward Bouvarie Pusey
- Frederick William Faber
Emphasising the continuity of the catholic identity of the Church of England.

This ‘reforming’ ecclesiology was contained in a series of 90 ‘Tracts for the Times’, published in
Oxford and widely-read. The Oxford Movement leaders became known as ‘Tractarians’.

For the leaders of the Oxford Movement, a new stress on Catholicity was the only antidote to
erastianism, spiritual bankrupcy and the erosive effects of post-enlightenment liberalism.

Things came to a head when John Henry Newman published ‘Tract 90’ in 1840, which argued that
the doctrine of the Church of England, enshrined in the Book of Common Prayer and the 39
Articles, was essentially the same as that of the Roman Catholic Church. In the wake of the
Gorham Controversy (1850), where a state court (the Privy Council) had overturned a judgement
by the bishops and the ecclesiastical courts over the nature of the Church of England’s doctrine.
Those who left included Henry Manning (who became the first Cardinal Archbishop of
Westminster) and F.W. Faber.

### Anglo-Catholicism and the Ritualist Controversy

The second phase of the movement, a new generation of younger clergy came through who
sought to see holiness worked out through more ornate and beautiful worship, including a
heightened sense of ceremonial. Many had half an eye on the practices of the Roman Catholic
Church, wanting to emulate the ceremonial, whilst using the text of the BCP. They introduced
things like:

* Candles on the table
* Eastward facing presidency
* Singing of the liturgy (outside cathedrals this was rare)

Tended to take place in poorly-endowed livings:

* Processions
* Reservation of the Blessed Sacrament
* Incense
* Roman Vestments (cottas, albs, stoles, chasubles, birettas)
* Unleavened bread in communion
* Making the sign of the cross

This was reported in the press, and a number of riots and disruptions occurred, engineered by
anti-Catholic agitators.

_Evangelicals began organised prosecutions of ritualist priests through the courts_.
The priests did not believe the secular courts possessed any spiritual authority in such matters, so as they were
often successfully prosecuted, they regarded this as martyrdom.

Godliness and self-sacrifice of the ‘slum-priests’: between 1876-1880, three urban priests were
prosecuted and imprisoned for ritualistic practices.

As the 19^th^ century moved into the 20^th^, there was a growing distaste by the wider church for
persecuting people who ritually departed from the BCP (although many Evangelicals continued to
persecute with zeal). Anglo-Catholicism was an increasingly powerful spiritual influence, whereas
Evangelicalism was steadily declining.

As a result, the Church of England in the 20" century generally has felt disinclined to use Canon
Law (or the law of the land) to hound those who liturgically deviate from the ‘legal’ line of the
Church of England on liturgy - especially when such liturgical creativity is coupled with spiritual
growth and dynamism.

So, the Anglo-Catholic *ritualists* were the pioneers of liturgical 
*freedom* (and anarchy) in the Church of England!

## Missionary Work

Colonialism opened way for missionary expansion, particularly successful in Africa.
The call to become a missionary was a major influence, particularly amongst evangelicals.

The export of denominationalism. (See reading project.)

## Science vs Religion

Early skirmishes: Galileo (1633)

Bishop James Ussher in 1648 dated the Creation to 4004BC.

Geology: dating of rocks led to different (much longer) chronology and also testing of the 6-day
hypothesis.

Charles Darwin: (1809 - 1882) Theory of evolution developed between late 1830s and the
publication of The Origin of Species (1859). The 1860s became a period of heated debate. T.H.
Huxley first to be explicit about link between humanity and apes - founder of “agnosticism” as a
religious position, based on the absence of evidence. The Oxford Debate between Huxley and
Bishop Samuel Wilberforce, Bishop of Oxford.

Three possible positions on science and religion emerged:
* Biblical literalism (believe the Bible and everything else needs to be adjusted);
* Integrate the Bible into the emerging scientific picture (with varying degrees of success);
¢ Abandon the Bible as a scientific source, retaining it for theology and ethics

This came to a head with the publication, in 1860, of the book Essays and Reviews, which caused a
storm over its approach to the Bible and Biblical authority and led to a trial for heresy (highly
unusual for those days!)

## The Second Coming

Conferences on biblical prophecy: Albury (1826-1830) and Powerscourt (1831-1833). Focus on
Daniel and Revelation, in particular. Believed to predict the, as yet, unfulfilled future.

Powerscourt was attended by J.N. Darby (1800 - 1882), initially an Anglican minister, then founder
of the Plymouth Brethren. He developed a form of pre-millennialism called dispensationalism.
Also invented the idea of the rapture - living Christians will meet Christ in the sky before a period
of terrible tribulation for the world. After destruction of the Beast of Revelation, they will return
with Christ to reign for 1000 years. Then will come the raising of the dead, the last judgement and
heaven and hell for all eternity. This scheme was implemented in the Schofield Chain-Reference
Bible, published in America and extensively bought. Dispensationalism then spread beyond
Plymouth Brethren thoughout America and, back, to the UK in the 20" century.
