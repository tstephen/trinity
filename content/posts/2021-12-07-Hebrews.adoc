 *** tent

 ** cf John which has security, here a real chance they will give up
 ** Disobedience = failing to endure rather than general sinfulness
 *** Heb 4:5-11

==== Heb 6
 
 ** 6:9 'we are confident' (NRSV) is perfect tense in Greek

 *** why need more if what we have is sifficient? It's not sufficient e need more Heb 7:1-14
 ** Better covenant, better ministry
 *** Moses' tabernacle a pale imitation of [platonic] ideal Heb 8:5
 *** Also Heb 10:1-4
 *** 'Once for all'
 *** Since priests continually sacrificing clearly something still to come Heb 9:1,6-10
 *** Compare Paul (esp. Romans) continue w Law or not? Both
 *** "Not replacement theology but fulfillment theology" Peter
 *** "too hard to do it alone" - Heb 10:19-25
 *** compare to current risk of continuing via Zoom
 *** "how much more": 'a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God' Heb 10:26-31

==== Heb 8:1-10:18 _How_ J carries out duties of High Priest

 * 8:1 'the main point: we have such a priest [as Melchizedek]'
   - 'Seated': completed in a way Levitical priests never are and more honoured as they may only stand in the presence 
 * 8:2 'true tent': again contrasting the human with the divine
 * 8:6-7 J has a better ministry, if the Mosaic covenant was sufficient there would be no need for a second one.
   - Not implying the first covenant was defective, people's inability to keep it is the problem.
 * 8:8b-12 Quote from Jeremiah 31:31â€“34
   - Author does not name the prophet because Jeremiah is just the mouthpiece, the authority is divine.
 * 8:8b 'new' is here _kainos_ meaning 'novel' compared to _neos_ in 12:24 meaning 'fresh' 
 * 8:10 '...my law in their minds and ... on their hearts' - Hebraic parallelism - poetic and emphasis. No longer mediatd by priests.

==== ch 9--The limits of the old covenant & Jesus' achievement

 * The first half (vv1-10) covers the _earthly sanctuary_ and rules for worship there
 * The second half (vv11-28) contrasts the _heavenly sanctury_ and worship there

==== ch 10--The new covenant--Christ's sacrifice once for all

 * vv1-18: The perfect sufficiency of J's sacrifice
   - v14: one sacrifice _has been made_ (perfect) but the beneficiaries _are being made_ holy (continuous present)
 * v26: further warning against apostasy (triggered by the reminder v25 that 'the Day is coming'?)--see ch 6; and yet
 * v39: confidence that apostasy will be avoided--a demonstration of 'spurring one another on' as in v24

==== ch 11 By faith, by faith, by faith

==== ch 12 therefore

 *** run with perseverance
 *** looking to Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith

== Summary

 * a sermon to Christians who are tired, failing and looking with longing back to Judaism (compare Israelites in desert longing for Egypt)
 * Towering theology
 * Jesus in every way superior to Judaism
 * not replacement but fulfilment (law pointed the way but insufficient)
 * J ultimat eHigh Priest, eternal order of M
 * enters true, heavenly sanctuary with Hisown blood
 * pays for sin once, not continually
 * full assurance to approach God
 * don't give up!
