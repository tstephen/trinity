## Speaking of God

In Chapter 2, I argued that Christians can make sense of their lives, individually
and corporately, as journeys on which they are being drawn deeper into the life of
God, and in Chapter 4 I will explore some ways in which that basic claim can be
expanded and enriched. This chapter, however, is a pause for clarification, and for
the introduction of some distinctions and terminology that should make the way
through the next chapter easier. I am going to look at different kinds of language
that Christians use to speak about God and, in particular, examine the question of
how Christians can speak about God at all without falling into idolatry.

I am going to:

* suggest that, for Christian theology, God is in one sense strictly unknowable,
but that in another sense God makes Godself known;
* claim that there are three broad types of Christian language about God: pragmatic, propositional and imaginative;
* introduce a fundamental distinction between God's immanent life and God's
economy (or the economy of salvation); and
* explain the analogical nature of Christian talk about God.

### Preparation

* Look through a Christian liturgy — you could try the ‘Liturgy of St. Cyril’, available
online from the Coptic Orthodox Church Network, at http://www.copticchurch.net/topics/liturgy/liturgy_of_st_cyril.pdf - and note all the different ways in which
God is named or described. Which of these ways of naming or describing or
referring to God look to you to be metaphorical? Which look like they are direct or
literal statements about God? Are there any that seem to you to be ambiguous?

### Additional reading

If you want to accompany my chapter with other accounts of the nature of religious
language, try:

* Jeff Astley, Exploring God-taik: Using Language in Religion, Exploring Faith: Theology for Life series (London: DLT, 2004). A general introduction to theological
language.
* Dan R. Stiver, The Philosophy of Religious Language: Sign, Symbol and Story (Oxford:
Blackwell, 1996). A somewhat more advanced account.
* Nicholas Lash, Holiness, Speech and Silence: Reflections on the Question of God
(Aldershot: Ashgate, 2004). Mentioned in the last chapter, but also very relevant here.

### Freedom and Idolatry

> ^6^Thus says the Lord, the King of Israel and his Redeemer, the Lord of hosts:
Lam the first and I am the last; besides me there is no god. ... ^8^Do not fear,
or be afraid; have I not told you from of old and declared it? You are my
witnesses! Is there any god besides me? There is no other rock; I know not
one.

> ^9^All who make idols are nothing, and the things they delight in do not
profit; their witnesses neither see nor know. And so they will be put to
shame. ^10^Who would fashion a god or cast an image that can do no good?
^11^Look, all its devotees shall be put to shame; the artisans too are merely
human. Let them all assemble, let them stand up; they shail be terrified,
they shall all be put to shame. ...

> ^13^The carpenter stretches a line, marks it out with a stylus, fashions it
with planes, and marks it with a compass; he makes it in human form, with
human beauty, to be set up in a shrine. ^14^He cuts down cedars or chooses a
holm tree or an oak and lets it grow strong among the trees of the forest. He
plants a cedar and the rain nourishes it. ... ^16^Half of it he burns in the fire;
over this half he roasts meat, eats it and is satisfied. He also warms himself
and says, ‘Ah, lam warm, I can feel the fire!’ The rest of it he makes into a
god, his idol, bows down to it and worships it; he prays to it and says, ‘Save
me, for you are my god!’

> ^21^They do not know, nor do they comprehend; for their eyes are shut, so
that they cannot see, and their minds as well, so that they cannot understand. ...

> ^21^Remember these things, O Jacob, and Israel, for you are my servant; I
formed you, you are my servant; O Israel, you will not be forgotten by me.
^22^I have swept away your transgressions like a cloud, and your sins like
mist; return to me, for I have redeemed you.
-- Isaiah 44:6,8-11,13-14,16-18,21-22

#### Exercise

Before reading on, think about this passage from Isaiah. What does the author
of this passage condemn, and what does he praise? What implications might
this polemic have for Christian attempts to witness appropriately to God?

---

In the previous chapter, I argued that freedom and faithfulness -- God’s freedom to transcend any definitions arrived at by God’s people, and God’s faithfulness to the promises declared to those people in the past and in the present
-- are constitutive of God’s self-identification. That continues to be true in this
passage from Isaiah. At first sight, it presents us with two sets of people. On
the one hand there are the people of Israel, directly addressed and declared to
be God's witnesses; they know God as the rock upon which they stand and as
their Lord, their King and their Redeemer. They know God’s identity ‘from of
old’, and may trust God to be true to it.

On the other hand stand the idolaters or false witnesses who are not
addressed but described with biting sarcasm. They do not know God; they
substitute for the true God things made with their own ‘merely human’ hands.
They worship mundane realities that they can control and use for their own
benefit; their gods are in their power.

In one corner, then, we have the true witnesses who rest in the hands of
their God; in the other, the false witnesses who hold their god in their hands.
There is a twist in Isaiah's oracle, however. God says to those who are being
addressed directly and comfortingly as true witnesses, ‘I have swept away
your transgressions like a cloud, and your sins like mist; _return to me_, for
I have redeemed you.’ Having been addressed as those in the right, it becomes
clear that they are no strangers to the wrong, and perhaps have not yet abandoned it. Tug on this thread and the passage, with its commendation of true
witnesses and condemnation of false, unravels to reveal a plea to Israel to
repent, to turn away from false witness and from idolatry, and to become the
true witnesses that they are not. The problem of idolatry is not somebody
else's problem — it is theirs.

This passage was, of course, written in a specific historical situation, and
addressed to a people involved in various very specific forms of idolatry.
Nevertheless, it is a tributary of one deep stream of Jewish thinking that was
eventually to flow into a more radical interpretation of idolatry. Idols were
eventually abjured not because they were representations of the wrong god,
nor because they were the wrong kind of representation of the right God,
but just because they were _representations_, and God was held to be beyond all
representation. This God is held not to be the kind of God who can aptly be
depicted ‘in the likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is on the
earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth’ (Exodus 20.4). No particular part of creation — visible or invisible, natural or artificial, animate or
inanimate, human or animal -- can be an adequate representation of the God
who is the source of them all.’

Many theologians in both Judaism and Christianity have wrestled with the
snares buried in any human description of God because they have been all
too aware that human beings are perennially tempted to tame God, to remake
God in their own image, or to slip God into their pockets. They have known
that all descriptions that human beings might be capable of deploying are
finite, because they are built from words whose everyday applicability is to
finite things in the world, and because they are painted with imaginations
all of whose colours come from life in the midst of that world. To use these
descriptions of God is always to describe God in terms more normally applicable to things that are not God. Any talk about God — any picture, any image,
any account, any story, any name, any description, any theory, any hypothesis
~ therefore presents believers with the temptation to absolutize something
finite, something made with human hands (or human voices or human minds).
That is, any talk about God presents a temptation to take a finite description
not as a hand gesturing towards a God who is always more surprising than
any description allows, but rather as a tool that enables the believer to grasp
hold of God, to delimit God, to make God out as finite — to define God, and so
to limit and define the demand that is made by knowing God.

---
#### Some Examples

Consider the following descriptions of God:

**Rock:** It is not difficult to see that this is a metaphor, describing God in terms
appropriate to something that is not God. It is (or was, when the metaphor
was fresh) a striking way of helping people to glimpse God’s faithfulness and
dependability, but the limit to how far one can take the metaphor is obvious;
it is a limit that one would find oneself beyond were one to ask what God's
mineral content was. for instance. Christians know that God is not a rock, so
to describe God as one presents little temptation to idolatry.

**Wise:** What about this one, though? It too is a word whose meaning we learn
first through ordinary human examples — from which we gather that it means
something like ‘able to judge appropriately, on the basis of long experience’.
But what can one make of the idea of God having ‘long experience’, or even of
God weighing up possible courses of action and judging appropriately?’ There
are clear limits to how far this description goes, too — even though, as we shall
see below, descriptions of God as wise or goed or loving don’t work in quite
the same way as the description of God as a rock.

**Infinite:** This might seem to be a good, abstract word, free from inappropriately
material or human associations. But it, too, is a word whose meaning is learnt
in particular contexts, as part of particular practices. It is possible, after all,
to give a human (social, material) history of the contexts and practices and
forms of imagination that have surrounded this word's emergence and development.
If one thinks that the word directly describes some characteristic
of God (instead of being, say, a comment upon the inadequacy of all finite
descriptions) one will eventually find that it too has smuggled in contraband
assumptions or illegal connotations — material that properly belongs only on
the creaturely side of the border.

#### Exercise

Return to the liturgy that you looked at in preparation for this chapter. Would
you now assess differently any of the names or descriptions of God that you
found in it?

---
 
God says ‘I am who I am’ and ’I am the God of your ancestors’ to the same
people, at the same time. It is not that one category of people, the idolaters,
need to be reminded that God is beyond their false definitions, while another
category of people, true witnesses, can be told to rest content with the
proper definitions that have made it into their possession. This passage from
Isaiah suggests, rather, that there might be an ongoing interplay between the
two messages. On the one hand, the Israelites are told, ‘Here is how God has
defined Godself’; on the other, they are told, ‘The God who has done this is,
and remains, a God who is beyond all definition’ God makes Godself known
— but God cannot be known.

This will seem like a direct contradiction until one realizes that the word
‘know’ has more than one meaning. If, by ‘God can be known’, we mean that
God could be grasped and understood, defined and explained, or that human
beings could gain intellectual mastery over this subject matter, then Christian
theology denies that God can be known even by Christians, even by those to
whom God has revealed Godself. God is, in that sense of the word ‘know’,
radically and inherently unknowable.

For Christians, I said in the previous chapter, the word ‘God’ names the
source of the life of the Christlike love and justice into which they believe
they are being caught up. The relation in which they stand to that source
will not be that of knowing subjects facing a known object, able to define it
or to gain some kind of intellectual mastery over it. Rather, they will stand
as those who are themselves in the process of being mastered by the one
they face, and the forms of language appropriate to this will not be calm
descriptions or abstract definitions, but expressions of praise, thanksgiving
and penitence -- language squeezed out of them as they find themselves
grasped by God.

#### The unutterability of God
> ‘For if a man cannot look upon the sun, though
it be a very small heavenly body, on account
of its exceeding heat and power, how shall not
a mortal man I be much more unable to face
the glory of God, which is unutterable?”
-- Theophilus of Antioch, To Autolycus footnote:[Theophilus of Antioch, To Autolycus 15, in A. Cleveland Coxe (ed), Ante-Nicene Fathers, vol. 2 (New York: Christian Literature Company, 1885), p. 90, available online from the Christian Classics Ethereal Library, http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anfo2.v.html.]

Consider someone illuminated by a bright light. The light shines on him
and on everything around him, and enables him to see himself and his surroundings in new ways, and so to live in new ways in those surroundings. He
can see the quality of the light by attending to how it shines on the different
surfaces around him, and by paying attention to the way the shadows fall he
can learn from where in the sky above him this light streams. In one sense,
therefore, he can ‘know’ the source by seeing what and how it illuminates.
But if he turns upwards, to face the source itself, the light will be blinding. He
won't be able to see the source itself directly — not so as to see how it works, or
how the light is generated in it. The light outstrips the capacity of his eyes, and
they become useless, even though the searing blindness that he experiences
is itself a sign that he is looking in the right direction. One ancient Christian
writer described this as a ‘brilliant darkness’: a light so bright that it is
tantamount to blackness.footnote:[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, Mystical Theology, 1 (997B) in Pseudo-Dionysius: The Complete Works, ed. Colm Luibheid (Mahwah, NJ: Paulist, 1987), p. 135. A different translation edited by Arthur Versluis, in which the relevant phrase is translated as ‘dazzling obscurity’, can be found in Esoierica 2 (2000), pp. 203-11, and is available online at http://www.esoteric.:msu.edu/Volumell/MysticalTheology.html.]
Look directly at it and you can see no more than if you
were left wholly in the dark.

This, too, is a metaphor that will only roll so far. Nevertheless, Christian
theologians have often stressed that alongside the kind of knowing of God
that I discussed in the previous chapter, a proper account of the knowledge
of God must include this radical unknowing - this affirmation of the abiding
unknowability of the source. ‘No one has ever seen God’ (John 4.12; John
1.18); ‘no one shall see me and live’ (Exodus 33.20). And this is no abstract
conclusion forced upon Christians by speculative philosophers, denying
something that Christians would otherwise have cheerfully affirmed, it is,
rather, something that God is believed to have taught and to go on teaching. In the burning bush, in the prophecies of Isaiah, on the cross, God is
weaning Christians from forms of knowing that have the nature of God all
wrong.

#### Bridled minds

> ‘God, indeed, from time to time showed the presence of his divine majesty by
definite signs, so that he might be said to be looked upon face to face. But
all the signs that he ever gave forth aptly conformed to his plan of teaching
and at the same time clearly told men of his incomprehensible essence. For
clouds and smoke and flame (Deuteronomy 4.11) although they were symbols
of heavenly glory, restrained the minds of all, like a bridle placed on them,
from attempting to penetrate too deeply.’
-- John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion®

Yet, Christian theologians have affirmed, God does indeed make Godself known. God reveals Godself, and God’s freedom does not trump God's
faithfulness or promise. The knowledge in question is the kind of knowledge that I discussed in the last chapter: the knowing that is like knowing
a piece of music; the knowing that consists in participation in what God is
doing; the knowing that finds its object most clearly displayed not in an
abstract definition but in an ensemble of lives being made holy. The negative
declaration of God’s unknowability is nothing more than the declaration
that this kind of musical, living, participatory knowledge is the only kind of
knowledge of God available. God makes Godself known, and in that very
process makes known God's unknowability outside of this provision. God
cannot be known in anything other than the ways in which God makes Godself known.

The question remains, however, whether this form of knowing leaves
Christians any kind of speech about God? Does this kind of knowing allow
Christians any direct description or definition of God’s nature? Perhaps appropriately, in a discussion that focuses on forms of language other than direct,
literal description, I am going to begin my answer to that question with an
extended parable.

#### Key points

* All representations of God contain the possibility of idolatry.
* If by ‘know’ we mean ‘grasp fully, define and explain’, then God is
unknowable.
* Christians nevertheless believe that God makes Godself known.

### Acknowledging the sun

There was once a king who sought a counsellor who would understand the
workings of the natural world. Many men and women applied for the post,
but any appearance of knowledge or wisdom crumbled under his questioning, and he sent each of them away. One day, his servants told him that another
applicant had arrived, that she was waiting in the Great Hall - and that she
seemed promising. The king quickly made his way there from his chambers
and, without any greeting, as soon as he had opened the door, he asked her:
‘Tell me, madam, what is the sun’?

‘It is a vast fire, sir, suspended in the emptiness of space’

His face fell. ‘Well then, tell me more. Is there air in space?’

‘No, sir, I don’t believe there is. Ah, I see your problem: fires need air to
burn, so how can the sun be a fire in airless space?’

‘Quite, quite. And what of fuel?’

“Fuel, sir?’

“Yes - fires need fuel. What fuel is burnt by the sun? Where does it come
from?’

‘A good question, sir. I answered hastily -- the sun, I meant to say, is like
a vast fire, and we may think of it imaginatively as being “suspended” in
space!

‘So can you, then, tell me what the sun really is?’

The woman fell quiet for a while, and then looked up at him with a smile.
‘No, sir, I do not know what the sun really is. At least, I cannot tell you what
the sun really is, but—’ she hesitated for a moment, and then continued, ‘I can
show you. Would you come with me, sir, over to the balcony?’

He was sufficiently intrigued to walk with her through the doors that
opened on the East side of the room, onto the hall balcony. He glanced up
at the morning sun, trying to glimpse something of its true nature — but as
always the glance half-blinded him: he did not see the sun so much as the
dancing spots that the glare left in his eyes. ‘I can barely look at it,
madam--and the same is true of you, I suspect.’

‘Of course, sir, but that is not what I meant. Staring at the sun will not
answer your questions about it. But you can feel its warmth, can’t you?’ He
could, even through the breeze. ‘And look out at your kingdom, sir: you may
not be able to look at the sun, but the sun enables you to look at all this. That’s
what the sun is: the source of the warmth on your skin, and the light by which
you see the world. You may not be able to know the nature of the sun directly,
but you can know yourself and your world as bathed in its light.’

His grunt might have indicated approval, but after a moment he said, ‘Very
good, madam -- but that is not enough. Anyone can feel that warmth and see
in that light. I've been hoping to find an _expert_, someone who can tell me the
suns secrets. I was hoping you might be such an expert.

‘No, sir, not me.’ She paused again, and then continued, ‘but I do know
where to find such experts. Look over there, and tell me what you see.’ She
pointed out at the landscape spread below them. He looked, and saw nothing
but the spreading fields and his people at work on them. He frowned. ‘Who
out there is an expert on the sun, madam? Don’t play games!’

‘Over there, sir — those people in the fields. They work every day under the
sun, and know what it feels like in every season. They work every day with the
sun, and know when to plant and when to harvest, when to work in the fields,
and when to stay in the shade, how to cover their heads to keep themselves
cool, and how to treat themselves if they get burnt. If you want to know what
the sun is, look at them. Or, better, go out there in the fields with them and
start learning its ways. You won't necessarily find any new words for the sun
in that way -- you may still only be able to call it a vast fire hanging in space,
knowing all the while that those words are inadequate -- but you will know
the sun, nonetheless.’

The king thought for a while, caught between a feeling that he was being
cheated of a real answer to his question, and a building admiration for her
response. After a minute or two staring down at the baked fields, he spoke
again. ‘But is there nothing you can say directly about the sun -- no
description that you can offer me that is not pictorial and inadequate.'

‘Well, yes, in a way. I have already done so, have I not, by describing what
the sun is not. It may be like a fire, but as you demonstrated a moment ago we
know quite firmly and clearly that it is not a fire in any sense we understand.
More positively, though, I suppose we could also say quite firmly that the sun
is the source of the heat and light that you feel and see with, and that those
people are working with. That is a direct statement about the sun, even if we
don’t know how the sun is the source of these things.’

'Yes, yes - but the first is knowledge of what the sun is not, rather than
knowledge of what the sun is.’ He paused, and then continued, ‘And the
second does not really add anything to what you said before: it simply repeats
your claim that the people in the field know the sun. Or rather, it gives the
name “sun” to what the people in the field know. It is really a statement about
their knowing of the sun, isn’t it, not a statement that tells me directly what
the sun is. Is there nothing else you can offer me?”

When she spoke again, it was with a half smile: 'Yes, sir, I have one more
thing. Though I do not think it will satisfy you. The people down there in the
fields tell all sorts of stories about the sun: that it is a golden apple thrown each
morning by an imprisoned hero to his no-less imprisoned heroine; that it is a
boat sailing across the sea with a burning sail, that it is -- yes -- a huge fire lit by
the Gods to warm the earth, but that the demons sometimes steal the fuel and
sometimes pile too much back on, trying to freeze or burn the earth. They don’t
seem to mind that the stories contradict one another. But those stories, sir, are
important: they are part of the way in which those people learn how to live with
the sun; they shape their imaginations, and so shape their actions. Because of
those stories, people do know the sun not only in what they do, but in what they
think and say, and their knowledge is true knowledge, sir, even if their words
and stories are not ones that we could claim speak directly of the sun.

‘Will that do, sir?”

The king paused before answering. He was still not satisfied: these were
not the kinds of answers he had been hoping for. But he could not think of
another way of asking his question, and in any case was now too distracted by
the thought that he had no idea what salary it was appropriate to pay to this
woman once he appointed her.

### Pragmatic, propositional and imaginative

In this parable, the prospective counsellor offers the king three ways of speaking about the sun. Those three ways are analogous to three kinds of Christian
talk about God.

The first kind of talk I call ‘pragmatic’ because it is focused on activity”
The prospective counsellor explains to the king that although she cannot tell
him directly about the sun, the workers in the field do know about it - and
their knowledge is shown in the patterns of their activity, the shape of their
lives. She only gives the sketchiest possible outline of the sort of thing she
means ~ they ‘know when to plant and when to harvest, when to work in the
fields, and when to stay in the shade’ ~ but if she had wanted to tell the king
in more detail what the workers know about the sun, she could have done
so by describing their lives, their practices, in more detail. And that is what
Imean by ‘pragmatic’ language: the kind of theological description that, as a
way of speaking indirectly about God, speaks about the shape and texture of
lives that respond to God. Christian theology can speak about the patterns of
Christian life - of prayer, of worship, of mission, of reading, of relating ~ with
the conviction that God is the reality to which that patterned life is a response.
In the previous chapter, this was what I was suggesting: I was refusing to talk
too directly and independently about God’s love, and instead saying that one
must attend to lives that have been and are lived in response to that love. Such
lives, I said, are the best, the most direct language about God that Christians
have: God is known in the lives of all those individuals and communities
who have heard the call of God, who have begun to learn Christlike love and
justice, and who therefore display the identity of God. Pragmatic description of
such lives is therefore the best, most direct way that a theologian’s words can
speak about God. Everything else is commentary.

---
#### Cultural-linguistic theology

The American theologian George Lindbeck has suggested
that Christians be thought of as analogous to a people
who have a distinctive culture, and who speak a
distinctive language. Think of an anthropologist
visiting a remote island tribe whose language and
culture are uncharted. The theologian's job, Lindbeck
suggested, is like the job of this anthropologist:
he must get to know this people's culture and language,
trying to reach the point where he can understand both
the language and the patterns and rules that govern the
culture in which that language is embedded --
discerning the cultural as well as the linguistic
‘grammar’ that shapes this people’s life. Doctrines,
for Lindbeck, are not primarily statements of theories
about God’s nature; they are ways of stating some of
the rules by which this people governs its behaviour.
It is only, he says, the lives that are governed by
these doctrinal rules that should be thought of as
making a claim about the nature of God.*

---

The second kind of language I am calling ‘imaginative’. The prospective
counsellor referred to the stories and metaphors that enable the workers in
the field to pass on their understanding of life in the sun. This richly varied,
extravagantly imaginative language is not mere decoration that could be
abandoned without real loss to the substance of their understanding; it is a
necessary part of how their understanding is shaped. In fact, the use of this
imaginative language is one of the practices by which they relate to the sun:
it is one of the practices that pragmatic language about them will describe.
A pragmatic description will focus on their saying of these things, and the
role taken by that saying in the overall shape of their lives. The imaginative
language itself is the content of what they say: the stories and images and
metaphors and parables that place in a communal store their wisdom about
the sun.

The case with Christian language about God is similar. Christianity boasts
a lush and extravagant growth of imaginative language about God. Such language is not dispensable; it is not mere decoration, or a sop for the hard of
thinking. It shapes the imaginations of those who use it, and so shapes the
lives that they live — and so it plays an indispensable role in sustaining and
shaping the way that their lives respond to God.

Human beings are, after all, imaginative creatures, and inhabit the world
by imagination. To be active in the world requires us to see the stuff around
us not simply as a bewildering variety of pure sense-impressions, but to see
it as a world of objects or circumstances with which we can interact. This
‘seeing as’ is a matter of imagination, and that imagination is shaped by metaphors and parables and stories more powerfully than by apparently direct,
literal description. Staring in front of me now, I see a patch of grey with a
strange, luminous patch of blue within it, and within the patch of blue a white
rectangle speckled with black marks. Or rather, that’s not what I see, unless
I take my glasses off: I actually see a computer monitor, with a blue desktop
pictured on it, and a white document on that desktop, covered with writing.
I see it, in other words, as something I can understand and work with — as
containing possibilities for action. My ability to see it in this way, and so my
ability to engage with it, is shaped by my having learnt various metaphors,
similes and stories: I see the blue desktop as being like a physical desktop,
a space on which I can arrange my work; I see the white patch as a piece of
paper on which I am typing ~ and so on?

In just the same way, one could think, for instance, of Rowan Williams
speaking of God loving ‘the reflection of his love within creation; he cannot bear to be separated from it and goes eagerly in search of it, hungry to
find in the created “other” the reality of his own life and bliss’. Eagerness,
hunger, inability to bear separation ~ these are words fit for finite human
lives, words that are clearly inadequate when applied to God; and yet this
inadequate, extravagant image is one that enables the reader to see the love
of God in a new light, and so to respond to it and live with it in a new way.
By making possible a richer lived response to God, it enables truer reference
to God.

 

The third kind of Janguage I am calling propositional.” It is the kind of language that tries to set down in unambiguous language clear statements of fact
about God. Its statements can then be subjected to careful logical analysis to
see what does and what does not follow from them.

You will have noticed -- and, after the last chapter probably not have been
surprised — that the prospective counsellor is rather evasive about using this
kind of language. There are direct statements in what she says, however, and
they are direct statements that say something about the sun. What she says is,
in fact, full of such statements.

On the one hand, she makes clear claims about what the sun is not, saying for example that ‘it is not a fire in any sense we understand’. Yet she uses
such language to ensure that the king will not be tempted to look for the
wrong kind of statement about the sun. Her propositional statements both
warn against thinking that there are direct, positive ways of speaking about
the sun, and warn against taking imaginative language as if it were literal
description. Nevertheless these statements do convey something, however indirectly, about the sun itself.

On the other hand, she spends a lot of time making the more positive claim
that the king himself in minor ways, and the workers in the fields in richer and
more complex ways, are genuinely responding to the sun. Her explanation of
that is full of direct statements: she says things like, ‘the sun is the source of
the heat and light that you feel and see with, and that those people are working with’, As the king points out, however, what she says simply ‘gives the
name “sun” to what the people in the field know, and it is really a statement
about their knowing of the sun ... not a statement that tells me directly what
the sun is’. Even though her propositional statements do make claims about
the sun, and do so quite definitely and in one sense informatively, the claims
are once again made indirectly.

You may recognize some of what I said in the last chapter and earlier in this
as belonging squarely in this propositional camp. Most obviously, there was
my claim that ‘God’ is the name of the source of the Christlike love and justice
that flows through people’s lives. That is a positive propositional claim, and it
is definitely a claim about God, but it is not itself a direct description of God,
It is a statement about where one can find something like a description of God:
look to the lives of those caught up in God’s life.

On the other hand, there is my negative propositional claim that God’s own
love is beyond human imagination and understanding, like the sun whose
light we can see when it shines on the world around us, but which blinds us
when we look towards it. That is equally clearly a kind of claim about God,
but it is a negative one: it says who or what God is by denying that one’s normal ways of naming and understanding realities in the world work in God's
case.

In the kind of theology I am exploring in this book, propositional language
is most at home in these indirect modes, talking about God by explaining
why in God's case one should not look to one’s normal ways of grasping and
explaining reality but instead should look elsewhere ~ to the lives described
in pragmatic language and to the imaginative language employed in those
lives.

---
#### Propositionalism

Some theologians, of course, believe that propositional claims can do a great
deal more than this. They hold that it is possible to speak much more directly
and much more fully about the nature of God's life in a propositional idiom,
setting down clear definitional statements about who and what God is. The
philosophical theologian Richard Swinburne, for instance, at the start of his
book on The Existence of God, states:

I take the proposition ‘God exists’ (and the equivalent proposition ‘There is
a God’) to be logically equivalent to ‘there exists necessarily a person without a body {i.¢., a spirit) who necessarily is eternal, perfectly free, omnipo
tent, omniscient, perfectly good, and the creator of all things.’

Chapter 2 has already shown what I think of this. I believe it makes better
Christian sense to see this kind of apparently direct, positive claim about God
as in fact a commentary upon or summary of that deeper Christian knowledge
of the love of God that is found in Christian lives.

Let me give an example. if Swinburne is asked to expand on what he means
by ‘omnipotent’, he says:

By God's being omnipotent, I understand that he is able to do whatever it is
logically possible (.e., coherent to suppose) that he can do.

Later in this book (in Chapter 10), when i expand on what I think ‘omnipotent’
means, I say:

if I say, for instance, that ‘God is omnipotent’, I won't understand what that
means by trying to come up with an abstract definition, and then arguing
about what God must be able to do. I will discover what those words mean
as I iearn what it means to live with the trust that there is no situation in
which God's love fails, no reality or extremity in which God's love is extinguished or finally defeated.

That is, I take this sort of apparently direct, positive proposition ‘God is omnipotent’ as no more than a convenient shorthand for something more complex: a ‘pragmatic’ description of a pattern of Christian life and imagination,
coupled with the propositional claim that this aspect of Christian life truly
‘responds’ to God. To treat it as a straightforward definitional claim as Swinburne does is, I believe, to mistake the kind of knowing of God that is available
to human beings.
---

So, there are at least three different kinds of language at work in Christian
theology: pragmatic, imaginative and propositional. Pragmatic language
describes lives; imaginative describes the imaginations of the people living
those lives; and propositional claims comment on the other two, making
direct claims about what those lives and imaginations amount to.

---
#### Exercise

Try putting this threefold division to work. Either keep it in mind as you read
through another chapter of this book, or read some other theology book, asking whether you can distinguish these three kinds of discourse — pragmatic,
imaginative and propositional — and whether it helps to do so.

--- 

#### Key points

* Christian theology involves ‘pragmatic’ language: the description of the
image of God in Christian lives.
* Christian theology involves ‘propositional’ language: statements that aim.
to speak clearly and directly about God.
* Christian theology involves ‘imaginative’ language: description of the
stories and metaphors that help shape Christian imagination, and therefore
Christian life.
* Propositional language, in the kind of theology I am exploring, is mostly
used to lay out ground rules for other ways of referring to God.

### Imananence and economy

One day, when the new counsellor was dining with the king, she reminded
him of their conversation about the sun. ‘Sir’, she said, ‘I have been thinking
further about our knowledge of the sun. I wrote a letter to an astronomer I
know ~ a man who spends all his time either observing the stars and planets,
or developing mathematical models of how they move. He suggested a distinction that I had not thought of before’

‘What distinction is that?’

‘Well, think about the workers in the field, and all the things they know
about the sun’

“Yes, yes: they know about its heat, its light, the patterns of its rising and falling, the changes in its strength throughout the year. We discussed all this.’

‘Well, sir, my astronomer friend pointed out that not everything they know
is of the same kind. The heat that they know, for instance, is truly the heat of
the sun - even if they can have no idea of how the sun produces that heat,
or what the heat of the sun itself is like all the way up at the sun itself. Even
though the bearable heat that they feel, live with and respond to is very dif
ferent from the unimaginable fire of the sun’s own heat, they are right to think
that the sun itself is, in some sense, hot — and to understand that hotness by
analogy with the heat they themselves feel’

“You do like making things complicated, don’t you. I think I understand so
far, though. Carry on!’

‘He pointed out, sir, that many of the other things that the people know
work rather differently. Take the rising and setting of the sun, for instance.

The sun itself does not rise and set; it is thanks to the turning of our world
that we experience the sun as rising and setting, Or the strengthening and
weakening of the sun over the seasons: that has, he says, to do both with the
tilt of our world’s axis, which means that the sun’s path through our skies is at
some times of the year more directly overhead than at other times; and it has
to do with the path that our world takes around the sun, sometimes closer to
the sun and sometimes further away’

‘I see your meaning. These things that the people know, they are facts about
how we and our world relate to the sun, and not facts about the sun itself? Yes,
yes, I see that. Sunset, sunrise, the seasons. Of course the sun itself does not
move up and down; it does not grow hotter in summer and cooler in winter
~ it is constant. But, yes, the path that we take around it is so arranged that we
experience it in these changing ways’

‘Yes, sir’

‘Ah, but has your astronomer friend noted that we take that path because
of the sun, though? If I understand these matters aright, our world is held
on its path around the sun by the sun. The movement we have that makes us
experience the sun as rising and setting, strengthening and weakening, is a
movement arranged by the sun, a movement the sun has given us?"

‘Very good sir! I had not thought of that. I will write to him again at once’
She had learnt already that, even with this genial monarch, a little flattery
now and then was a sensible precaution. After all, she did not want the sun to
set any time soon on her position as counsellor.

This story can help us to make an important distinction, between claims about
the sun as it is experienced in the lives of the people and claims about the sun
as itis in itself, On the one hand, there are what we call ‘economic’ claims, not
because they have anything to do with any financial arrangements, but because of an older sense of the word ‘economy’. It comes from the Greek words
oikos, meaning household, and nomos, meaning law, and could refer to the way
someone puts their domestic affairs in order, the way that someone makes
provision for his or her family. So ‘economic’ claims are, in this context, those
that focus on the patterns into which the sun has arranged the lives of those
who respond to it. How does the sun appear to those people, and how is the
nature of the sun seen in the way that their lives are arranged?

On the other hand, there are ‘immanent’ claims. They are claims about what
the sun itself is truly like, regardless of the position of the people making the
claims. Immanent comes from the Latin immanere, to dwell or remain within,
and can mean both ‘indwelling’ and ‘inherent’. Here it is the latter that is in
view: what properties are really inherent in the sun? What properties dwell
not in the relationship between sun and observer, but in the sun itself?

 
---
#### The ambiguity of immanence

There are two different uses of the word ‘immanent’ in theology, and they
should not be confused. On the one hand, there is the usage I am sketching
at the moment: ‘immanent’ is used in contrast to ‘economic’ to speak about
I what is true of God in and for Godself. On the other hand, ‘immanent’ can also
be used in contrast to ‘transcendent’ to talk about God's presence in and to
God's creation — God's closeness or intimacy to the worid. It is particularly
important not to confuse these two meanings as they are almost direct opposites, one having to do with God considered in abstraction from any relation
I ship to the world, the other having to do precisely with the intimate quality of
that relationship.

---

In my story, claims about the heat of the sun are both economic and immanent.
On the economic side the heat of the sun is something that the people experience, that they know and work with in their daily lives. Yet on the immanent
side the astronomer claims that the people experience this heat from the sun
because the sun is itself hot. The heat that the people experience and the heat
that the sun has in itself might be of vastly different orders of magnitude, and
the sun’s inherent heat might be impossible to imagine properly (no one, after
all, could ever experience it because to experience it would be to die); nevertheless, the two are intimately connected. The sun’s immanent heat produces
the economic heat that the people feel, and because of that connection, the
economic claim that the sun feels hot can become the immanent claim that the
sun is hot.

Claims about the sun rising and setting, however, are only economic. The
people can rightly claim that the sun rises and sets — but what they are
talking about is only the sun-as-seen-from-their-vantage-point, the
sun-as-theyexperience-it. The economic claim ‘the sun rises and sets for
us’ cannot be turned into the immanent claim ‘the sun itself inherently
rises and sets’. Someone who lived not on a rotating planet but on a
planet that always turned the same face towards the sun would not
experience the sun as rising and setting:
it would be a constant presence, always in the same quarter of their sky.

Alongside this talk about the sun that is only economic, and alongside the
talk that is both economic and immanent, could one have talk that is only
immanent? That is, could one have talk about what the sun is inherently like
that was not at the same time talk about some aspect of how the sun appears
in human lives? One might think, perhaps, of the theories of the astrophysicists, which declare that the sun has an inner core taking up about one fifth
of its diameter, that this core has a density of some 150,000 kilograms per
cubic metre, and that it is powered by a fusion reaction that converts hydrogen to helium. Even these, of course, are claims based on empirical data, and
so claims that have their roots in some rather refined aspects of how the sun
appears in our lives. The chains of analysis and disciplined speculation involved in developing these claims from that data are so long and tangled,
however, that there remains very little direct sense in which claims about the
size, density and nature of the sun's core are also claims about how we relate
to and experience the sun. The economic base of these claims has been left so
far behind that they have almost achieved pure immanence.

Of course, no one uses the words ‘immanent’ and ‘economic’ when talking about
the sun: they are theological terms used when talking about God.
‘Economic’ refers to God's ‘economy of salvation’ — the arrangements that God
has made for God’s world, and the knowledge that God’s people have in that
economy of who God is for them: how God appears to them, from their vantage point (a position or vantage point that God has given them). ‘Immanent’,
on the other hand, refers to what God is in Godself; God’s inner or essential
nature ~ what God is like not just when seen from one particular vantage
point, but absolutely.

On page 58, I asked whether Christian theology allows any kind of direct
description or definition of God’s nature. I can now rephrase that question.
Most of what I said in the last chapter was focused on the economic level, in that
it had to do with who God appears to be in the lives of believers, or how the
lives of believers constitute a kind of claim about who God is for us. I have also,
in that chapter and this, been insisting on the unknowability of God — that is,
the idea that direct, clear statements about God's nature are deeply problematic. In other words, I have been denying that God’s immanent life is a reality
that one can easily or straightforwardly talk about. So, the question that faces
us now is, ‘Does Christian theology allow one to say anything about who God
is immanently ~ or does it abandon the attempt, and allow God’s imrnanent life
to remain wholly swathed in mystery?’ I may say, economically, that to learn
to know God is to learn to know oneself and one’s world as bathed in God's
love, and that to know God is to learn to recognize oneself and one’s world as
called to participate in that love. But can I go further, and say that God is love,
immanently - that this love characterizes God's essential nature?

#### Key points

* In theology, ‘economic’ description of God refers to God as he is experienced, learnt and responded to by Christians caught up in the ‘economy of
salvation’.
* God's ‘immanent’ life is what God is in Godself.

### Analogical language

Imagine that you have a CD player with one of those graphic displays on
which there are several columns of coloured lights showing you the levels of
sound being put out at different frequencies. Imagine that you have sucha CD
player in front of you, but that the speakers are disconnected, so that no sound
is audible. Imagine that there is a CD in the player, and that you have pressed
‘play’. No sound comes out, but the display is working, so you see the various
columns of lights pulsating up and down, sometimes staying quite low and
green, sometimes becoming taller and acquiring red tops.

In other words, you have a CD player equipped with visualization equipment, and what you see on that equipment has to do in general with that
equipment’s features, its connections and components. But what you see
when this specific music CD is played is what happens when the connections
and components of this equipment are taken up and used by this music: the
music conforms this equipment to itself, and makes this utterly unmusical
equipment (equipment that plays lights, not sounds) communicate something
of the music.

You could describe the visual display that this equipment produces using
words appropriate to the visual world: ‘This bit of the music is very tall; this
bit has lots of red; in this bit the column tops slope down to the right, in this bit
they slope to the left; in this bit the whole thing is very jumbled up. ...’ These
are the spatial, visual words appropriate to the visual display, and they are
not musical words as such; they don’t tell us directly about the music (unlike
words like ‘loud’ or ‘quiet’ or ‘rumbling’ or ‘deep’). These visual words are adequate to the visual display, but they are decidedly inadequate as descriptions
of the music: what would it mean to say that music was tall, red or sloped?
Were you finally to connect the speakers, the music you would hear would
utterly exceed this visual language that you have now developed for it.

And yet, because the graphical display is a faithful representation of the
music, the description that you offer of it can, in a way, be true of the music.
It is capable of getting hold of something real about the music; there is some
feature of the music, some real feature, that corresponds to each of the words
that you use to describe the display. When the columns are taller on the right
than on the left, that does mean something about the music. When there is a lot
of red on the screen, that does mean something too.

Something a little like that is going on in the move from description of the
economy of salvation to claims about the immanent nature of God. A Christian
can attend to and describe the patterns of the economy — the processes in his~
tory and in her life by which she believes God has addressed the world and
begun to draw it into that love and justice which are God’s life. She can speak
and think about this economy using the pragmatic and imaginative language
appropriate to it: language appropriate to a sequence of events and relationships lived out in time; language appropriate to human imaginations.

She can, however, believe that this economy is like the pulsating of the CD
player's lights: it is a faithful transcription of the melody of God’s immanent
life, a transcription that is true to that life, even though it is a transcription for
a medium utterly different from that life. This transcription does not make
the immanent life of God fully knowable and graspable, any more than flashing lights let one hear a CD’s music ~ but it does make possible some kind
of true knowledge of that life. The full, unimaginable reality of the immanent life of God exceeds the economy just as surely as the music of Beethoven
pouring out of the speakers would exceed the lines of green and red lights
winking on and off on the front of a CD player ~ but she can claim that the
immanent nature of God, while remaining utterly beyond her, is nevertheless
truly given to her in the economy.

This picture of Christian speech about God suggests that one can arrive
at a description that is in some sense true of God, even if the reality that one
is describing so far exceeds one’s ability to describe it that one cannot know
how one’s description is true. This is called ‘analogical’ speech: it works on the
basis that there is an analogy or similarity between what one says using frail
human words and God’s immanent life, even though any such similarity is
qualified by a still greater dissimilarity: the dissimilarity between God’s life
and the life of the world. The heat of the sun that I feel is analogous to the
heat of the sun itself, even though the heat of the sun itself is not something I
could possibly imagine: it exceeds the limits of what could be experienced by
bodies like mine.

On reflection, this might seem a rather useless claim. Of what use is a true
description of God if one cannot know what it means for it to be true — if the
reality to which it points remains ungraspable? Christian theologians have
replied that such description can be of use precisely because the primary purpose of one’s talk about God is not the development of accurate description,
nor the provision of explanatory theories or models of God. Christian talk
about God is an ingredient in the processes by which Christian lives are conformed fo God. The claim that Christian speech about God can, despite God’s
unknowability, be analogically true speech about God's immanent nature is
simply one aspect of the broader claim that Christian life in response to God
can, despite God’s unknowability, be life that is truly being drawn to share in
its own way in the immanent life of God.

The claim, as it were, is that the visual display is genuinely plugged into the
music, such that someone whose attention and language is kept in conformity
to that display is himself (in a sense) plugged into that music. Similarly, by the
grace of God’s action in the economy of salvation, Christian language can be
genuinely plugged in to the music of God’s immanent life, and so Christian
life that is guided and shaped by this language can be genuinely plugged in
to that divine music.

‘The kind of knowledge of God available to human beings, according to this
theology, is not primarily a matter of accurate description or convincing explanation: it is primarily a matter of lives caught up to share in God’s life. But
within that kind of knowing-by-living there can, nevertheless, be a certain
kind of theoretical knowing, a certain kind of ability to describe God, a certain kind of ability to speak the truth about God ~ a way of speaking that, even
though it is limited and inadequate, can be meaningfully claimed to be true.

#### Key points

* Christian theologians have claimed that the economy of salvation is a transcription into creaturely terms of God's immanent life.
* They have claimed that to be caught up in this economy is therefore, in a
sense, to participate in the immanent life of God.
* They have also claimed that the speech about God that the economy makes
possible can be true speech about God's immanent nature.
* Such speech is true only analogically, however, and believers cannot know
how what they say applies to God.

### Love all the way

Why should it be important to make this claim? Once the distinction between
‘economic’ and ‘immanent’ has been made — the distinction between God as
God is in Godself, and God as God appears to or engages with the world—why
should anyone insist that Christian response to God, Christian life in relation
to God, somehow connects with or shares in the immanent life of God?

As my parable about the sun suggests, to say that some claim about God
is purely economic would be to suggest that what one sees of God from this
vantage point might change were one to move to another vantage point. That
is, to say that something is purely economic would be to say that, in principle,
one could be in some time or place or situation or state from which that something would not be true of God — just as one could be on a planet from which
the sun could be seen not to rise and set.

To insist that the claim that ‘God is love’ is not simply economic, but applies
analogically to God’s immanent life, is to claim that there is no imaginable
vantage point from which God will not be seen to be love. There is no place
that one could go to, no time at which one could arrive, no situation in which
one could find oneself, in which God would be anything other than love. God
is love all the way down.

That may sound like the kind of statement that nobody could disagree
with. Yet if you think back to the previous chapter (or if you read on into
the next), you will remember that, for Christian theology, the true meaning of love is found in Jesus of Nazareth. For a Christian theologian, to say
that God is love all the way down is to say that God is Christlike all the way
down. ‘God is Christlike and in him there is no unChristlikeness at all’, as the
twentieth-century Anglican theologian Michael Ramsey said." God, according to Christian theology, is immanently Christlike.

---
#### Against elitism

There is another reason for insisting on the link between an economic understanding of God and God’s immanent life. it is that link that ensures that the
understanding of God found among ordinary believers — the workers in the
fields, who know how to live with and respond to God’s love — is a knowledge
that gets to the heart of who God is. There is not some different kind of knowledge available only to theological experts who have got beyond the economic
level, a knowledge that leaves behind the naive level of ordinary believers and
grapples with the real nature of God. The love of God that ordinary people
know goes all the way down, and the only ‘experts’ are those who know most
deeply that they are loved, and love most deeply themselves. Those are forms
of knowledge that do not necessarily go with academic prowess or ecclesiastical preferment.

--- 

‘To insist that God is love, that God is Christlike, ‘all the way down’ - that
to learn at Christ’s hands the love of God is to learn the immanent heart of
God — is to believe that one need have no hesitation about making a lifelong
commitment to this way of learning God. This is a pathway, Christians trust,
that goes all the way into the heart of God, and travellers along this path will
never reach a time or a place where it peters out and leaves them stranded.
To bind oneself to this pathway, to make the lifelong investment of time and
energy and attention that is involved in taking it with utmost seriousness, is
not to keep oneself to the economic shallows: it leads on, Christians believe,
into the immanent depths.

#### Key point

* To claim that God makes God’s immanent life known in the economy is to
claim that what Christians learn about God in the economy can be trusted
in all times and places.

### The analogy of love

In the light of all this, 1 can say more precisely what is going on when
Christians make the statement, ‘God is love’

1. In the first place, ‘love’ is a word that people learn in the midst of finitude
— by being loved by parents or carers, by reading love stories, by falling in
love, by loving their children, by living their lives. There is no one definition of ‘love’ that captures all of these; rather, people learn to use the word
‘love’ differently, but more or less appropriately, in each of a kaleidoscope
of human activities, situations and relationships. The uses of the word
‘love’ that people learn are not simply ‘univocal’ fall meaning exactly the
same thing); neither are they simply ‘equivocal’ (meaning several completely unconnected things). They are, rather, ‘analogous’: connected by various
degrees of resemblance. ‘Love’ is already a stretchy word.

2. To say ‘God is love’ is to attempt to say something about God’s immanent
life. But to apply this word to God is to stretch it far beyond its ordinary
limits ~ unless one starts imagining that God is simply a big version of
a human being, with emotions and understanding and conumitments that
work in much the same way that ours do. Christians are certainly called
by God’s economy of saivation to imagine God as the one who loves the
world passionately and consumingly, who is so given over to love that there
is nothing in God that is not love. And yet they are also called to imagine
one who loves purely ~ that is, one who loves without selfishness, without
particular interests, without an ego that is fed or advanced by this love. So
although Christians have certainly said that ‘God is love’, and have normally regarded themselves as saying something about God’s immanent life
when they do so, theologians have traditionally argued that Christians do
not (and cannot) know quite what they are saying when they do so; they
cannot imagine quite how love works in the case of God.

3. Nevertheless, Christians are committed to using this word of God because
of what God has done - loving them in Jesus of Nazareth, and beginning
to draw them into Christlike love. That is something that they can grasp;
it happened and happens in the finite world of people and things, which
is the very world for which their words are suited. So Christians say ‘God
is love’, not because they can imagine or define exactly how it is true - not
because they can imagine or define exactly the God. who is loving - but
because they trust God as the ineffable source of the love that encounters
them in Christ, and catches them up into itself.

4. Learning to say ‘God is love’ is therefore inseparable from the process by
which Christians are taught what true love is by being loved truly. The love
shown to them in Christ is not, they believe, simply one more example of
love to set alongside all the others. It is the example of love ~ and learning to
recognize oneself and the world around one as loved by this love begins to
change one’s understanding of (and so practice of) love. This is a love that
one learns by learning to become loving.

5. Christian theologians have therefore affirmed that there is a sense in which
‘love’ is a word used most properly of God (even though they cannot know
how love works in God’s case), God is the source of perfect love, and God's
love is the criterion for all human love. All a person's finite and imperfect
loves are therefore given a standard outside themselves: they are called
to account before God’s love. To say ‘God is love’ is therefore inseparably
bound up with the critique of all one’s other ways of using the word ‘love’
~ both the ways in which one has personally learnt (and sometimes mislearnt) how to love, and the ways in which one’s culture enshrines various
ideas and confusions about love.

---
#### Love in culture

Learning the meaning of love involves a journey into the resources and probjems of our culture. We are surrounded by images of love in books and films
and television programmes and adverts and posters and songs. Some of
them are good and some of them are dreadful; some of them are profound,
and some of them have ~ to use a wonderful phrase from J. K. Rowling — ‘the
emotional range of a teaspoon’.® The journey on which Christians learn what
‘love’ means is a journey into discernment about all these images — a slow
learning to differentiate between the help and the hindrance that each can
offer. The field of ‘theology and culture’ (theological explorations of films
and novels and television programmes and computer games) is not, as is
sometimes suggested, a less-than-serious distraction from the real business
of theology: it is an unavoidable part of learning the meaning of the word
‘God’.

--- 

The statement ‘God is love’ certainly looks like a direct propositional statement about God. And to a certain extent, it does work like one: it conveys a
kind of true information about God. But if my analysis of the nature of this
analogical claim is right, it is not a statement that can be extricated from the
Christian lives and imaginations that are its context. The claim ‘God is love’
cannot be separated from the kinds of reality spoken of in pragmatic and
imaginative Christian language. This is a statement about God’s immanent
life only because it remains a commentary upon that economic reality.

---
#### Communicable and incommunicable

Traditionally, a distinction has been made between ‘communicable’ and ‘incommunicable’ attributes of God. Love is a classic communicable attribute: as
I have been emphasizing, it is an attribute that can in some sense be shared
by God’s creatures. The same would be true for wisdom, justice, faithfulness
and goodness, among many others; all of these work in the same way that
lL have been suggesting ‘love’ works. On the other hand, an incommunicable
attribute would be something like ‘omnipresence’ — an attribute that can’t be
shared by God’s creatures. That does not mean that to speak of God as omnipresent is somehow to capture Ged more directly. God's omnipresence is just
as thoroughly unimaginable as God’s love, and claims about that omnipresence are no less bound up with Christian lives and imagination. To say that
‘God is omnipresent’ is best thought of as a commentary upon Christian lives
lived in the faith that there is nowhere one can go to evade God’s presence,
howhere one can find oneself where God’s love is not at work. There may be
no meaningful sense in which Christians are called to become omnipresent
themselves,” but even an incommunicable attribute like this is something
that is best understood by looking to the patterns of Christian life.

--- 

#### Key points

* To say that ‘God is love’ is to use a stretchy human word.
* To say that ‘God is love’ is to stretch that word beyond its familiar limits.
* To say that ‘God is love’ is to comment upon the way that God appears in.
the economy of salvation.
* Saying that ‘God is love’ is inseparable from the process by which Christians learn the nature of love.
* God's love is the criterion for all human love.

#### Going further

1. You can find a clear introduction to the nature of analogy in theological
language in Brian Davies, An introduction to the Philosophy of Religion, 3rd
edn (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003), ch. 7. David Burrell’s Analogy
and Philosophical Language (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1979) and
his Aquinas: God and Action (Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press,
1979) are worth a look if you want a real mental workout.

2. I have not said very much about the use of metaphor to speak about God.
A good place to start further exploration of this topic is with Janet Martin Soskice, Metaphor and Religious Language (Oxford: Clarendon Press,
4985) and Colin Gunton, The Actuality of Atonement: A Study of Metaphor,
Rationality and the Christian Tradition (Edinburgh: T&1 Clark, 1988), ch. 2:
‘Metaphor and Theological Language’.

3. In discussions of the attributes of God, one in particular has caused a good
deal of controversy: the impassibility of God — which can loosely be thought
of as the idea that God cannot suffer. For a discussion of this attribute, see
Thomas G. Weinandy, Does God Suffer?, new edn (Notre Dame: University
of Notre Dame Press, 2000).

### Notes

1. I will return to this in my discussion of the doctrine of creation, in Chapter 7.

2. For more on God weighing up courses of action, see Chapter 10.

3. See, for example, Paolo Zellini, A Brief History of Infinity (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 2005), Brian Clegg, A Brief History of Infinity: The Quest to Think the Unthinkable
(London: Constable and Robinson, 2003) or Eli Maor, To Infinity and Beyond: A Cultural
History of the Infinite (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1987).

20, tr. Ford Lewis Battles (London: SCM Press, 1961 [from 1559 Latin textl), 1.11.3, p. 102.
A different translation, by Henry Beveridge (Edinburgh: Calvin Translation Society,
1845-6), is available online at the Christian Classics Ethereal Library, http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes.iv.ii.xii.html,

7. Pragma properly means a thing that has been done, a deed, an act ~ so ‘pragmatic’
means something like ‘related to action’.

8. See George Lindbeck, The Nature of Doctrine: Religion and Theology in a Postliberal
Age (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1984). For a good discussion, see Chad Pecknold,
Transforming Postliberal Theology: George Lindbeck, Pragmatism and Scripture (London:
Continuum, 2005).

9. Graphical User Interfaces for computers are regularly discussed in terms of
the ‘metaphors’ they employ. See, for example, Steven Johnson, ‘Is the computer
desktop an antique: soon, Apple and Microsoft will need new metaphors for their
operating systems’, Slate Magazine (10 Dec 2002), available online at
http://slatemsn.com//?id=2075219.
See also Tim Rohrer, ‘Metaphors we compute by: bringing magic to
interface design’, Online Center for the Cognitive Science of Metaphor, 1995; available

10. Rowan Williams, Ponder These Things: Praying with Icons of the Virgin (Norwich:
Canterbury Press, 2002), p. 27.

11. If the ‘pragmatic’ category is my way of trying to do justice to the culturallinguistic theology of George Lindbeck, the ‘imaginative’ is my way of trying to do
justice to the work of some theologians normally considered his opponents ~ theologians like David Tracy, whom Lindbeck clumsily labelled ‘experiential expressivists’
(see Lindbeck, The Nature of Doctrine, pp. 31-2). See, for example, David Tracy, The
Analogical Imagination: Christian Theology and the Culture of Pluralism (New York: Cross
road, 1981). ;

12. I toyed with calling this form of language ‘ontological’ (ie. ‘relating to being’),
because it is concerned with the making of direct claims about what (and whether)
God is ~ but that sounded a little precious. It is my way of trying to do justice to at
least some of those that Lindbeck would have labelled ‘cognitivist’ or ‘propositional
ist’ (Lindbeck, The Nature of Doctrine, pp. 16, 92). _—

15. A.M. Ramsey, God, Christ and the World: A Study in Contemporary Theology (London: SCM Press, 1969), p. 99. This has implications for inter-religious dialogue, as we
shail see: it means (if one takes it seriously) that such dialogue cannot operate by seeking a lowest-common-denominator understanding of God that takes the Christlikeness of God simply as a Christian way of seeing a God who is not inherently Christlike.
In Chapter 12, I will explore the implications that such a claim has for the relationship
between Christianity and other religions — and argue that it need not mean a rigid
Christian exclusivism.

17. Although one could say that the call to proclaim the gospel everywhere is a call
toa certain kind of omnipresence. For more on such proclamation, see Chapter 14, pp.
345-8 below.
