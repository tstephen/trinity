# A short introduction to the life and thought of St Augustine
:toc:

## Early life

Aurelius Augustine was born in 354 AD to a pagan father, Patricius, and a Christian mother, Monica. They lived as farmers in Thagaste, modern day Souk Ahras, Algeria footnote:[Braudel, Fernand (1995). A History of Civilizations. Penguin Books. p. 335. ISBN 9780140124897. "A Berber, born in 354 at Thagaste (now Souk-Ahras) in Africa..."].

## Confessions

Augustine's most famous work is Confessions and it provides an autobiographical account of his long journey to orthodox faith from the time he starts to become self-aware as a teenager to after his conversation and elevation to Bishop of Hippo. This occupies the first nine books with the final three devoted to an exegesis of Genesis 1 in what was to become his characteristic alegorical style.

As the title makes clear--and he repeats time and again--by the time he is writing Augustine sees this journey as sorely testing the patience and mercy of God. This tone of penitence and desire to document his inner life is no doubt intended to provide a coherent and persuasive philosphical case for Christian faith.

## Education

From what Augustine tells us in Confessions they were of slender resources yet his father seeks his advancement through education first in Madaura and then in Carthage, by successfully seeking the help of a wealthy patron footnote:[Confessions, book 2, chapter 3].

Augustine's reflections, albeit much later, on these aspirations remain a challenge to parents to this day: all around praise Patricius for his generosity but Augustine focuses on the neglect of his spiritual education, taking no account of the fact that his father is not even, at that stage, a Christian.

> Who did not extol my father, for that beyond the ability of his means, he would furnish his son with all necessaries for a far journey for his studies' sake? For many far abler citizens did no such thing for their children. But yet this same father had no concern how I grew towards Thee, or how chaste I were; so that I were but copious in speech, however barren I were to Thy culture, O God, who art the only true and good Lord of Thy field, my heart. footnote:[]

Once in Carthage, Augustine wastes no time embracing all the big city has to offer

> But in those days in the theaters I sympathized with lovers when they sinfully enjoyed one another, although this was done fictitiously in the play. And when they lost one another, I grieved with them, as if pitying them, and yet had delight in both grief and pity. Nowadays I feel much more pity for one who delights in his wickedness than for one who counts himself unfortunate because he fails to obtain some harmful pleasure or suffers the loss of some miserable felicity. footnote:[Confessions book 3 chapter 2]

In addition to exploring his carnal side he was also on a search for eloquence, rhetoric being a high calling in Roman society.
In the course of this, he also discovers Cicero's Hortensiusr--a book now lost to us that concluded seeking wisdom is the greatest use of one's time. That turns Augustine's head more even than the delights of the city.

> Now it was this book which quite definitely changed my whole attitude and turned my prayers toward thee, O Lord, and gave me new hope and new desires. footnote:[Confessions book 3, chapter 4]

This search for wisdom drives him to search the scriptures but, he finds them 'quite unworthy to be compared with the dignity of Tully' (a familiar reference to Marcus Tulius Cicero). Augustine himself, in retrospect, puts this down to his own vanity though others have excused it as a reflection of the poor Latin of the available Scriptures.

## Manichaeism

Instead he turns to the followers of Mani, founder of a pseudo-Christian cult in which he claimed to the Paraclete, promised by Jesus in John 14-16.

In what must surely be a conscious reference to Lady Wisdom that he is seeking, Augustine recognises his actions as following instead The Foolish Woman of the second half of Proverbs 9 by whom he is both metaphorically and literally seduced at this time. footnote:[Confessions book 3 chapter 6]

Augustine declares himself, at the time, attracted to dualism--that God is Spirit and opposed by an entirely separate, and evil, being that is responsible for creation and indeed all matter.
By the time he writes Confessions, he will clarify that evil cannot have its own existence:

> as yet I knew not that evil was naught but a privation of good, until in the end it ceases altogether to be; footnote:[https://ereader.perlego.com/1/book/1071715/2?element_plgo_uid=ch2__277&utm_medium=share&utm_campaign=share-with-location&utm_source=perlego[Confessions, Book 3, Chapter 7] and similar sentiments in Book 7, Chapter 12, City of God Book 11, Ch 22]

Concluding his studies, Augustine returns to practice as a rhetoratician in his home town.

A friend that he had grown up with and disuaded from Christianity to Manichaeism lies on what all believe is his death bed when he was baptised without his knowledge (apparently a common enough practice at the time).

Augustine's comment betrays his firm dualist views at that time:

> myself meanwhile little caring, presuming that his soul would retain rather what it had imbibed from me, than what was done to his unconscious body. footnote:[https://ereader.perlego.com/1/book/1071715/2?element_plgo_uid=ch2__722&utm_medium=share&utm_campaign=share-with-location&utm_source=perlego[Confessions, Book 4, Chapter 4]]

Yet his friend, reviving and learning of the surreptitious baptism did not find Augustine's teasing funny and admonished him. Augustine was 'confounded and confused' but kept quiet thinking to revisit the subject when his friend was fully better. However, before this could happen the fever returned and he died.

Augustine mourns his friend yet does not understand why; to the extent that he writes his tears succeeded his friend as dearest in his affections.

This and subsequent interrogation of Faustus, eminent bishop of the Manichaens, start to disillusion him and this leads him to Rome, now disavowing Manicheanism but still in the circle of that cult.

Book 5 concludes with him now in Milan via Rome deciding to break with the Manichaens even if he is unsure where to go instead and rejecting 'the Academics' (Neoplatinists) as they have no place for 'the saving name of Christ'. He resolves to be a catechumen of the Catholic church until something better comes along!

## Milan, Ambrose and conversion

Under Ambrose's influence Augustine finds himself drawn little by little by the Lord's 'gentle and most merciful hand'. footnote:[https://ereader.perlego.com/1/book/1071715/3?element_plgo_uid=ch3__539&utm_medium=share&utm_campaign=share-with-location&utm_source=perlego[Confessions Book 6, Chapter 5] but is reluctant to commit too quickly to Catholicism as one 'who has tried a bad physician fears to trust himself to a good one'.
footnote:[https://ereader.perlego.com/1/book/1071715/3?element_plgo_uid=ch3__512&utm_medium=share&utm_campaign=share-with-location&utm_source=perlego[Confessions Book 6, Chapter 4]

It was at this point he wrote the famous prayer to help with his addiction to sex that was so to inflame Pelagius later: 'Lord give me continence, but not yet' footnote:[Confessions, Book 8, Chapter 7].

The moment of conviction comes, he relates, under a fig tree in his garden (recalling his pear tree sins?) where he hears a voice telling him to read the scriptures.

Following eight months of instruction he is baptised by Ambrose on Easter Day AD 387. Shortly thereafter his mother dies, though not before she saw him saved as she had seen in a dream.

Two years after his conversion, Augustine returns to Africa and having been forcibly ordained presbyter, continues a monastic life though now in the service of the church as theologian in which role he attracts and trains a number of highly capable priests to the North African church.

## Against the Donatists

When Diocletian, as part of his persecution of Christians in AD 303-305, demanded Bishops hand over their Bibles some chose to comply others that did not rejected them and set up a rival 'pure' church.
Donatus was one such, an alternate bishop of Carthage, who gave his name to movement.
By the time Augustine became Bishop of Hippo the Donatists represented the majority and so it fell to Augustine to formulate a response.
He did so both in popular culture and rigourous theology and in AD 411 footnote:[TODO] under Emporer Honorius they were proscribed.

This work contained an argument that has had a lasting impact on the church. The church, he says, is not a pure society as the Donatists sought to establish. Whilst it is not possible to be saved outside the church it _is_ possible to be unsaved within it. So it follows that the church like all the individuals that make it up is still undergoing a process of sanctification and there can be no such thing as a perfected denomination this side of the second coming. TODO citation.

> In this wicked world, and in these evil days . . . many reprobate are mingled in the Church with the good. Both are as it were collected in the net of the Gospel; and in this world, as in a sea, both swim together without separation, enclosed in the net until brought ashore. footnote:[Dyson, City of God, 18,49]Â 

He also argued that sacraments do not depend for their validity on the standing of who administers them but that they have an intrinsic effectiveness of signposting Scripture and grace. footnote:[On Christian Doctrine 2.3 TODO]

Finally, and most unfortunately, Augustine's experience of seeing many Donatists readily return to the universal church encouraged him to see a degree of coercion as legitimate in subduing heresy citing 'The LORD disciplines those He loves' footnote:[Prov 3:13]. However, there is no suggestion that this could extend to torture as some have claimed to justify their actions. TODO cite.

## On the Trinity

Probably the greatest contribution of Augustine's 'De Trinitate' is to have been uncontroversial. Where Athanasius, the Cappadocean Fathers and most of all the Council of Nicea arose out of controversies and therefore took a polemic form, Augustine provided much needed balm starting as he does from the assumption of those 'Catholic expounders... who wrote before me' that:

> the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit intimate a divine unity of one and the same substance in an indivisible equality;3 and therefore that they are not three Gods, but one God footnote:[https://ereader.perlego.com/1/book/1069004/1?element_plgo_uid=ch1__1973&utm_medium=share&utm_campaign=share-with-location&utm_source=perlego[On the Trinity, Book 1, Chapter 4]]

Nonetheless, he is quite clear that the distinct persons of the trinity can undertake what J Burnaby calls distinct 'missions'. Only the Spirit descended on the Son at his baptism, only the Father spoke 'You are my son' and so forth.

> The first half of the De Trinitate deals with the problems raised
by the Catholic doctrines (a) that God is one, and that the whole
Trinity is active in all divine operations, and (b) that the three
"Persons" are distinct from one another not only for our apprehension but in their eternal being. footnote:[The Trinity, INTRODUCTION, Augustine Later Works Edited and translated by JOHN BURNABY, p19]

> In Books V-VII, Augustine passes
to the formulation of the faith in terms of the logical and
metaphysical categories which he shares like the Greek Fathers
with contemporary philosophyâespecially the Neo-Platonism
of Plotinus footnote:[The Trinity, INTRODUCTION, Augustine Later Works Edited and translated by JOHN BURNABY, p20]

Book V deals with Arianism at a technical level.

## Sack of Rome and City of God

On 24 August 410 the 'eternal city' of Rome fell to the Visigoths and sent shock waves through the Roman Empire physically, as wealthy citizens become refugees, and idiologically, as some advocated a return to traditional pagan gods to restore civic fortunes.

Once again Augustine was the one to construct a coherent rebuttal. The City of God critiques first and most harshly the notion that worship of pagan gods 'leads to happiness in this life' (Books 1-5) footnote:[This letter was discovered by Dom C. Lambot and published by him in the Revue benedictine, 51 (1939), pp.109f, quoted in https://ereader.perlego.com/1/book/1400065/15?element_id=p15--440&utm_medium=share&utm_campaign=share-with-location&utm_source=perlego[Dyson]] and then more sympathetically the current Neoplatonism (Books 6-10)
In the second half of the work he points his audience to the truth of Christianity described in the Bible (Books 11-22).
This takes the form of comparing two cities: One _civitas terrana_ is literally the 'Earthly City' or 'City of Man', the other, the _civitas dei_ is the 'City of God'.

> Human history, he demonstrates, has from the beginning been a battle between the City of Man, whihch is built on the love of self, and the City of God, which is built on the love of God.
footnote:[Reeves p97]

> Certainly, this is the great difference that distinguishes the two cities
of which we are speaking.  The one is a fellowship of godly men, and the other
of the ungodly; and each has its own angels belonging to it. In the one city, love
of God has been given pride of place, and, in the other, love of self. footnote:[https://ereader.perlego.com/1/book/1400065/645?element_id=p645--371&utm_medium=share&utm_campaign=share-with-location&utm_source=perlego[Dyson, City of God Book 14, Chapter 13]]

Augustine recognises a world where the bad rulers may prosper (for example Nero) as well as good (Constantine). In fact, whilst uncompromising on the error of paganism, Augustine is remarkably conciliatory towards the secular state. As Chadwick says the City of God is intended to 'allay the fears of educated pagans' and 'leave the institutions of society as free of clerical intervention as possible'. footnote:[Chadwick, p141]

But the Christian Empire is the closest thing to the City of God on earth and with certain, not insignificant, conditions Augustine is hopeful that a good emporer can advance that 'city'.

> if they rule justly; if they are not lifted up by the talk of those who accord them sublime honours or pay their respects with an excessive humility, but remember that they are only men; if they make their power the handmaid of His majesty by using it to spread His worship to the greatest possible extent; if they fear, love and worship God; if they love that Kingdom which they are not afraid to share with others more than their own; if they are slow to punish and swift to pardon... footnote:[https://ereader.perlego.com/1/book/1400065/29?element_id=p29--266&utm_medium=share&utm_campaign=share-with-location&utm_source=perlego[City of God Book 5, Chapter 24]]

At its heart each city is made up of the individual honesty and piety--or otherwise--of its members and its institutions simply reflect the aggregation of this to a larger scale. So, as when confronting the Donatists desire for a 'pure' church, Augustine is insistant that both cities co-exist since regenerate and unregnerate people co-exist in this world.

City of God is a work that despite the high level structure highlighted above ranges far and wide, often with lengthy diversions. This may betray its long gestation (from AD 413-426) and episodic style of a busy and distracted author. But it may also be seen that Augustine, as one entrusted with a flock, is fighting for each sheep, with every argument he can muster.

## Against Pelagius

Pelagius was a Welsh layman, educated in Gaul and settled in Rome around AD 398, 'practicing the aesetic life' says Chadwick footnote:[Chadwick, p145]. He was shocked by the moral laxity in the imperial city and moved to write commentaries on St Paul and tracts to the effect that sin is a moral choice for which we are responsible. Whilst God will help through both Scripture and Spirit, even to the extent that Grace may initiate, choosing the right path is ultimately a matter of will.

The heresy that bears his name was a concern shared by a loose collection of lay people and clerics that if every gift including will is by grace then nothing is demanded of humankind except to sit and wait for that grace, which its proponents could not accept.

Augustine for his part, finds this cruelly individualistic.
Inspired by the world he sees around him and his understanding of his own heart cannot think otherwise than that sin is intrinsic to all;
that we are all subject to the original sin that entered the world through Adam.footnote:[City of God, Book 13, Chapter 13]
However, he cannot go so far as to support total depravity, says Chadwick, or the basis of his theodicy (that evil is the privation of good mentioned above under Confessions) collapses. footnote:[Chadwick, p153]
Nonetheless this pressure from the Pelagians pushes him to say that people are so weak and helpless that left by grace to their own devices for even a moment they will fall into sin and so grace must be in control throughout.

> In the end Augustine comes to see that in every good action there is not one part which is ours and another that is God's: the whole belongs to both. footnote:[Chadwick, p150]

Augustine's other argument is quite simply that Pelagianism misses the love at the heart of the gospel.
The internal transformation of this love poured in through the Holy Spirit turns us from willing nothing but sin to right living:

> For free choice is capable only of sinning, if the way of truth rwemains hidden. And when what we should do and the goal we should strive for begins to be clear, unless we delight in it and love it, we do not act, do not begin, do not live good lives. But so that we may love it, the love of God is poured out in our hearts, not by free choice that comes from ourselves but by the Holy Spirit that has been given to us (Rom 5:5)footnote:[Augustine, The Spirit and the Letter Chapter 5]

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Augustine's influence both in the formative years of the early church and right down to our own time cannot be overemphasized. Many themes he tackled, often being the first to do so, are the same issues that occupy Christians and many others today: the nature of good and evil, free-will, grace, the trinity and the human condition.

His writings, though dense in parts still have the ability to stimulate curiosity and deeper in the twenty-first century mind.
