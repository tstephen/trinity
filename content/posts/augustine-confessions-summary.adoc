## Book 1

### 1

- Can one cry to God for help or must one first know Him?

### 2

- How can God come to me when a) I am unworthy a place for him to come and b) He is already everywhere?

### 3

- Is heaven and earth large enough to hold God or does He overflow somewhere else? And anyway heaven and earth is not like a cup holding God but rather the other way around!

- Are certain bits of God in certain places and other bits in other places?

### 4

- Paradoxes: active, yet resting; gather all, yet needing nothing.

### 5

- Beseeching God to call and correct.

### 6

- Every need provided by God from his mother's milk onwards.
- But where was I before my mother's womb, no one can tell me. 

> [Should I just] acknowledge you and praise you for what I do know?

- Our 'today' is insignificant compared to your timelessness.

### 7

The sins of even a one day old baby.

> if babies are innocent, it is not for
lack of will to do harm, but for lack of strength.

### 8

Learning to speak

> I taught myself by using the intelligence which
you, my God, gave to me.

### 9

## BOOK 2

### 1

Frank and regretful reminiscence of a wild youth.

### 2

- Confusion of lust with love. An awareness that God was silent, not intervening.
- A view of marriage as a means to tame sin, though not an especially positive view of marriage. 
- An awareness of God, in retrospect though not at the time:

> For your almighty power is not far from us, even when we are far from you.

- Harsh words for his family: 

> [My family's] only concern was that I should learn how to make a good speech and how to persuade others by my words.

### 3

- Studies interrupted as he returns home from Madaura, whilst his father seeks to raise money for him to be educated in Carthage. But not out of any concern for his growth in righteousness.
- His mother, though, thought otherwise and was 'apprehensive' and spoke to him [Augustine] as a 'faithful servant'.
- He recognises God's voice in his mother's words in retrospect but at the time revelled not only in 'dissolution' but in the resulting 'applause' of his friends.
- A graphic picture of both parents wishing worldly success above closeness to God.

### 4

The story of the pear tree and the sin of covetousness, and theft, not for the pears but for the joy of the sin itself.

### 5

Appreciation of beauty and material goods, but appreciation too of their potential to distract from 'higher goods'.

### 6

Comparisons of the 'merits' of sins and how they pale compared to God, for example: 

> Sloth poses as the love of peace: yet what certain peace is there besides the Lord?

### 7

- Consciousness of forgiveness and God as forgiver for both sins committed and averted. 
- [The first?] recognition of others likewise saved.

### 8

The companionship of partners in crime also part of the thrill of sin.

### 9

Confusion that he would not have done the crime alone but:

> ashamed to hold back when others say â€˜Come on! Let's do it!'

### 10

In summary, regret.

## Book 3

### 11

Seeing Augustine is 'dead by that faith and spirit' she had received, she mournes with 'tears that watered the earth ... in every place she prayed'. In a dream Augustine's mother is told 'that where she was, there I was also', namely in a state of grace. And she relates this to him.

### 12 

His mother implores a bishop to speak to Augustine but he wisely refuses saying he was still too in love with the heresy but urging Monica to pray for her son and he would see his error in due course.

## Book 4

### 1

From 19-28 he lived as a Manichae, but now confesses the folly in what he was once proud of.

### 2

Teacher, lover and father.

But would not support a soothsayer to offer sacrifices to devils for their support in a 'theatrical prize'.

### 3 

Turns instead to 'imposters, whom they designate Mathematicians' [astrologers] as they use no sacrifices in their divinations => more acceptable to 'Christian and try piety'.

'A wise man skilled in medicine' tells A that he abandoned astrology, where he had sought a living as he discovered it 'uterly false... and would not gain a living by beguiling people'

Any right predictions are 'pure chance' comparing it to poetry that might seem 'wondrously apposite' though the author intended something far removed.

Yet neither this medic nor 'my most dear Nebridius' could 'persuade me to forsake it'.

### 4

A friend that he had grown up with and disuaded from Christianity to Manichaeism lies on what all believe is his death bed when he was baptised without his knowledge. 

Augustine's comment betrays his firm dualism: 

> myself meanwhile little caring, presuming that his soul would retain rather what it had imbibed from me, than what was done to his unconscious body.

Yet his friend, reviving and learning of the surreptitious baptism did not find Augustine's teasing funny and admonished him. Augustine was 'confounded and confused' but kept quiet thinking to revisit the subject when his friend was fully better. However, before this could happen the fever returned and he died.

Augustine mourns his friend yet does not understand why - to the extent that he writes his tears succeeded his friend as dearest in his affections. 

### 5

Contemplating the sweetness of sorrow, Augustine asks 'is it the hope that Thou hearest us that sweetens it'.

### 6

How can he continue 'for I felt my soul and his soul were but one soul in two bodies'.

### 7

Unable to distract himself in any kind of pleasures he flees Thagaste for Carthage once more.

### 8

Time and friends salve his grief.

### 9

Love for a person must always die, but loving God can b=never be lost.

### 10

> Restore us, O Lord God of hosts;
let your face shine, that we may be saved.

## Book 5

### 1

> 'Thou alone art near even to those that remove far from Thee.'

> 'Thou wert before me, but I had gone away even from myself; nor did I find myself, much less Thee!'

### 2

Now 29, Augustine meets Faustus, most eminent Bishop of the Manichaens. He commends the rhetoric, of which he has already heard, but is not taken in by it.

### 7

It becomes clear that even Faustus cannot untangle all the astronomy of which Mani wrote, and whilst he compliments Faustus on recognising 'he was not altogether ignorant of his own ignorance' and consequently unwilling to be drawn into those things, it is the beginning of the end for Augustine's Manichaenism.

Augustine gives God the glory for thus losening his snare, not deserting his soul and recognising his mother's tears as 'a sacrifice offered to Thee for me'.

### 8

And so to Rome, despite his mother's lament and urging either not to go or to take her too - even tricking her to do so!

Whilst crediting God for guiding him he says his principal motivation was for better and better behaved students, though he was not blind to potential advancement too.

> But Thou, mysteriously counselling and hearing the real purpose of her desire, granted not what she then asked, in order to make me what she was ever asking.
