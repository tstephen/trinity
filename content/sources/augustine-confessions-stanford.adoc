### 1

> Can any praise be worthy of the Lord’s majesty?footnote:[Psalm 145:3]

> How magnificent his strength! How inscrutable his wisdom!footnote:[Psalm 147:5] 

Man is one of your
creatures, Lord, and his instinct is to praise you. He bears about
him the mark of death, the sign of his own sin, to remind
him that you _thwart the proud_ footnote:[1 Pet 5:6] But still, since he is a part of your
creation, he wishes to praise you. The thought of you stirs him so
deeply that he cannot be content unless he praises you, because #you
made us for yourself and our hearts find no peace until they rest in
you.#

Grant me, Lord, to know and understand whether a man is first to
pray to you for help or to praise you, and whether he must know you
before he can call you to his aid. If he does not know you, how can he
pray to you? For he may call for some other help, mistaking it for
yours.

Or are men to pray to you and learn to know you through their
prayers? _Only, how are they to call upon the Lord until they have learned
to believe in him? And how are they to believe in him without a ‘preacher to
listen to?_ footnote:[Romans 10:14]

Those who look for the Lord will cry out in praise to him,footnote:[Psalm 22:26] because
all who look for him shall find him, and when they, find him they
will praise him. I shall look for you, Lord, by praying to you and
as I pray I shall believe in you, because we have had preachers to
tell us about you. It is my faith that calls to you, Lord, the faith
which you gave me and made to live in me through the merits of
your Son, who became man, and through the ministry of your
preacher.

### 2

How shall I call upon my God for aid, when the call I make is for my
Lord and my God to come into myself? What place is there in me to
which my God can come, what place that can receive the God who
made heaven and earth? Does this then mean, O Lord my God, that
there is in me something fit to contain you? Can even heaven and
earth, which you made and in which you made me, contain you? Or,
since nothing that exists could exist without you, does this mean that
whatever exists does, in this sense, contain you? If this is so, since I too
exist, why do I ask you to come into me? For I should not be there at
all unless, in this way, you were already present within me. I am not
in hell, and yet you are there too, for _if I sink down to the world
beneath, you are present still_. footnote:[Psalm 139:8] So, then, I should be null and void and
could not exist at all, if you, my God, were not in me.

Or is it rather that I should not exist, unless I existed in you? For
_all things find in you their origin, their impulse, the centre of their being._ footnote:[Romans 11:36]
This, Lord, is the true answer to my question. But if I exist in you,
how can I call upon you to come to me? And where would you come
from? For you, my God, have said that you _fill heaven and earth,_ footnote:[Jeremiah 23:24] but
I cannot go beyond the bounds of heaven and earth so that you may
leave them to come to me.

### 3

Do heaven and earth, then, contain the whole of you, since you fill
them? Or, when once you have filled them, is some part of you left
over because they are too small to hold you? If this is so, when you
have filled heaven and earth, does that part of you which remains
flow over into some other place? Or is it that you have no need to be
contained in anything, because you contain all things in yourself and
fill them by reason of the very fact that you contain them? For the
things which you fill by containing them do not sustain and support
you as a water-vessel supports the liquid which fills it. Even if they
were broken to pieces, you would not flow out of them and away.
And when you pour yourself out over us, you are not drawn down
to us but draw us up to yourself: you are not scattered away, but you
gather us together.

You fill all things, but do you fill them with your whole self? Or
is it that the whole of creation is too small to hold you and therefore
holds only a part of you? And is this same part of you present in all
things at once, or do different things contain different parts of you,
greater or smaller according to their size? Does this mean that one
part of you is greater and another smaller? Or are you present entirely
everywhere at once, and no single thing contains the whole of you?

### 4

#What, then, is the God I worship?# He can be none but the Lord God
himself, for _who but the Lord is God? What other refuge can there be,
except our God?_ footnote:[Psalms 18:31] You, my God, are supreme, utmost in goodness,
mightiest and all-powerful, most merciful and most just. You are the
most hidden from us and yet the most present amongst us, the most
beautiful and yet the most strong, ever enduring and yet we cannot
comprehend you. You are unchangeable and yet you change all
things, You are never new, never old, and yet all things have new life
from you. You are the unseen power that brings decline upon the
proud. You are ever active, yet always at rest. You gather all things
to yourself, though you suffer no need. You support, you fill, and you
protect all things. You create them, nourish them, and bring them to
perfection. You seek to make them your own, though you lack for
nothing. You love your creatures, but with a gentle love. You
treasure them, but without apprehension. You grieve for wrong, but
suffer no pain. You can be angry and yet serene. Your works are
varied, but your purpose is one and the same. You welcome all who
come to you, though you never lost them. You are never in need yet
are glad to gain, never covetous yet you exact a return for your gifts.
We give abundantly to you so that we may deserve a reward; yet
which of us has anything that does not come from you? You repay
us what we deserve, and yet you owe nothing to any. You release us
from our debts, but you lose nothing thereby, You are my God, my
Life, my holy Delight, but is this enough to say of you? Can any man
say enough when he speaks of you? Yet woe betide those who are
silent about you! For even those who are most gifted with speech
cannot find words to describe you.

### 5

Who will grant me to rest content in you? To whom shall I turn for
the gift of your coming into my heart and filling it to the brim, so
that I may forget all the wrong I have done and embrace you alone,
my only source of good?

Why do you mean so much to me? Help me to find words to explain. Why do I mean so much to you, that you should command me
to love you? And if fail to love you, you are angry and threaten me
with great sorrow, as if not to love you were not sorrow enough in
itself. Have pity on me and help me, O Lord my God. Tell me why
you mean so much to me. _Whisper in my heart, I am here to save you._ footnote:[Psalms 35:3]
Speak so that I may hear your words. My heart has ears ready to
listen to you, Lord. Open them wide and _whisper in my heart, I am
here to save you._ I shall hear your voice and make haste to clasp you to
myself. Do not hide your face away from me, for I would gladly
meet my death to see it, since not to see it would be death indeed.

My soul is like a house, small for you to enter, but I pray you to
enlarge it. It is in ruins, but I ask you to remake it. It contains much
that you will not be pleased to see: this I know and do not hide. But
who is to rid it of these things? There is no one but you to whom I
can say: _if I have sinned unwittingly, do you absolve me. Keep me everyour own servant, far from pride._ footnote:[Psalms 19:12-13] _I trust, and trusting I find words to utter._ footnote:[Psalms 116:10]
Lord, you know that this is true. For have I not _made my transgression known to you? Did you not remit the guilt of my sin?_ footnote:[Psalms 32:5] I do not
wrangle with you for judgement,footnote:[Jeremiah 2:29] for you are Truth itself, and I have
no wish to delude myself, for fear that my malice should be self-betrayed.footnote:[Psalms 27:12] No, I do not wrangle with you, for, _if you, Lord, will keep record of our iniquities, Master, who has strength to bear it?_ footnote:[Psalms 130:3]

### 6

But, dust and ashes though I am, let me appeal to your pity, since it
is to you in your mercy that I speak, not to a man, who would
simply laugh at me. Perhaps you too may laugh at me, but you will
relent and have pity on me,footnote:[Jeremiah 12:15] For all I want to tell you, Lord, is that I
do not know where I came from when I was born into this life which
leads to death - or should I say, this death which leads to life? This
much is hidden from me. But, although I do not remember it all
myself, I know that when I came into the world all the comforts
which your mercy provides were there ready for me, This I was told
by my parents, the father who begat me and the mother who conceived me, the two from whose bodies you formed me in the limits of
time. So it was that I was given the comfort of woman’s milk.

But neither my mother nor my nurses filled their breasts of their
own accord, for it was you who used them, as your law prescribes, to
give me infant’s food and a share of the riches which you distribute
even among the very humblest of all created things. It was also by
your gift that I did not wish for more than you gave, and that my
nurses gladly passed on to me what you gave to them. They did this
because they loved me in the way that you had ordained, and their
love made them anxious to give to me what they had received in
plenty from you. For it was to their own good that what was good
for me should come to me from them; though, of course, it did not
come to me from them but, through them, from you, because you,
my God, are the source of all good and _everywhere you preserve me._ footnote:[2 Samuel 23:5]
All this I have learned since then, because all the gifts you have given
to me, both spiritual and material, proclaim the truth of it. But in
those days all I knew was how to suck, and how to lie still when my
body sensed comfort or cry when it felt pain.

Later on I began to smile as well, first in my sleep, and then when I
was awake. Others told me this about myself, and I believe what they
said, because we see other babies do the same. But I cannot remember
it myself. Little by little I began to realize where I was and to want to
make my wishes known to others, who might satisfy them. But this
I could not do, because my wishes were inside me, while other people
were outside, and they had no faculty which could penetrate my
mind. So I would toss my arms and legs about and make noises,
hoping that such few signs as I could make would show my meaning,
though they were quite unlike what they were meant to mime. And
if my wishes were not carried out, either because they had not been
understood or because what I wanted would have harmed me, I
would get cross with my elders, who were not at my beck and call,
and with people who were not my servants, simply because they did
not attend to my wishes; and I would take my revenge by bursting
into tears. By watching babies I have learnt that this is how they
behave, and they, quite unconsciously, have done more than those
who brought me up and knew all about it to convince me that I
behaved in just the same way myself.

My infancy is long since dead, yet I am still alive. But you, Lord,
live for ever and nothing in you dies, because you have existed from
before the very beginning of the ages, before anything that could be
said to go before, and you are God and Lord of all you have created.
In you are the first causes of all things not eternal, the unchangeable
origins of all things that suffer change, the everlasting reason of all
things that are subject to the passage of time and have no reason in
themselves. Have pity, then, on me, O God, for it is pity that I need.
Answer my prayer and tell me whether my infancy followed upon
some other stage of life that died before it. Was it the stage of life that
I spent in my mother’s womb? For I have learnt a little about that
too, and I have myself seen women who were pregnant. But what
came before that, O God my Delight? Was I anywhere? Was I anybody? These are questions I must put to you, for I have no one else
to answer them. Neither my father nor my mother could tell me, nor
could I find out from the experience of other people or from my
own memory. #Do my questions provoke you to smile at me and
bid me simply to acknowledge you and praise you for what I do
know?#

I do acknowledge you, Lord of heaven and earth, and I praise you
for my first beginnings, although I cannot remember them. But you
have allowed men to discover these things about themselves by watching other babies, and also to learn much from what women have to
tell. I know that I was a living person even at that age, and as I came
towards the end of infancy I tried to find signs to convey my feelings
to others. Where could such a living creature come from if not from
you, O Lord? Can it be that any man has skill to fabricate himself?
Or can there be some channel by which we derive our life and our
very existence from some other source than you? Surely we can only
derive them from our Maker, from you, Lord, to whom living and
being are not different things, since infinite life and infinite being are
one and the same. For you are infinite and never change. In you
‘today’ never comes to an end: and yet our ‘today’ does come to an
end in you, because time, as well as everything else, exists in you. If it
did not, it would have no means of passing. And since your years
never come to an end, for you they are simply ‘today’. The countless
days of our lives and of our forefathers’ lives have passed by within
your ‘today’. From it they have received their due measure of
duration and their very existence. And so it will be with all the other
days which are still to come. But you yourself are eternally the same.
In your ‘today’ you will make all that is to exist tomorrow and thereafter, and in your ‘today’ you have made all that existed yesterday
and for ever before.

#Need it concern me if some people cannot understand this? Let
them ask what it means, and be glad to ask: but they may content
themselves with the question alone. For it is better for them to find
you and leave the question unanswered than to find the answer without finding you.#

### 7

Hear me, O God! How wicked are the sins of men! Men say this and
you pity them, because you made man, but you did not make sin in
him.

Who can recall to me the sins I committed as a baby? For in your
sight no man is free from sin, not even a child who has lived only one
day on earth. Who can show me what my sins were? Some small baby
in whom I can see all that I do not remember about myself? What
sins, then, did I commit when I was a baby myself? Was it a sin to cry
when I wanted to feed at the breast? I am too old now to feed on
mother’s milk, but if I were to cry for the kind of food suited to my
age, others would rightly laugh me to scorn and remonstrate with
me. So then too I deserved a scolding for what I did; but since I could
not have understood the scolding, it would have been unreasonable,
and most unusual, to rebuke me. We root out these faults and discard
them as we grow up, and this is proof enough that they are faults,
because I have never seen a man purposely throw out the good when
he clears away the bad. It can hardly be right for a child, even at that
age, to cry for everything, including things which would harm him;
to work himself into a tantrum against people older than himself and
not required to obey him; and to try his best to strike and hurt others
who know better than he does, including his own parents, when they
do not give in to him and refuse to pander to whims which would
only do him harm. This shows that, #if babies are innocent, it is not for
lack of will to do harm, but for lack of strength.#

I have myself seen jealousy in a baby and know what it means. He
was not old enough to talk, but whenever he saw his foster-brother
at the breast, he would grow pale with envy. This much is common
knowledge. Mothers and nurses say that they can work such things
out of the system by one means or another, but surely it cannot be
called innocence, when the milk flows in such abundance from its
source, to object to a rival desperately in need and depending for his life
on this one form of nourishment? Such faults are not small or unimportant, but we are tender-hearted and bear with them because we know
that the child will grow out of them. It is clear that they are not mere
peccadilloes, because the same faults are intolerable in older persons.

You, O Lord my God, gave me my life and my body when I was
born. You gave my body its five senses; you furnished it with limbs
and gave it its proper proportions; and you implanted in it all the
instincts necessary for the welfare and safety of a living creature. For
these gifts you command me to acknowledge you and _praise you and sing in honour of your name_ footnote:[Psalm 92:1], because you are Almighty God, because
you are good, and because I owe you praise for these things, even if
you had done nothing else, No one but you can do these things,
because you are the one and only mould in which all things are cast
and the perfect form which shapes all things, and everything takes
its place according to your law.

I do not remember that early part of my life, O Lord, but I believe
what other people have told me about it and from watching other
babies I can conclude that I also lived as they do. But, true though
my conclusions may be, I do not like to think of that period as part
of the same life I now lead, because it is dim and forgotten and, in this
sense, it is no different from the time I spent in my mother’s womb.
But if _I was born in sin and guilt was with me already when my mother conceived me,_ footnote:[Psalm 51:5] where, I ask you, Lord, where or when was I, your servant, ever innocent? But I will say no more about that time, for since
no trace of it remains in my memory, it need no longer concern me.

### 8

The next stage in my life, as I grew up, was boyhood. Or would it be
truer to say that boyhood overtook me and followed upon my infancy ~ not that my infancy left me, for, if it did, where did it go?
All the same, it was no longer there, because I ceased to be a baby
unable to talk, and was now a boy with the power of speech. I can
remember that time, and later on I realized how I had learnt to speak.
It was not my elders who showed me the words by some set system
of instruction, in the way that they taught me to read not long afterwards; but, instead, I taught myself by using the intelligence which
you, my God, gave to me. For when I tried to express my meaning
by crying out and making various sounds and movements, so that
my wishes should be obeyed, I found that I could not convey all that
I meant or make myself understood by everyone whom I wished to
understand me, So my memory prompted me. I noticed that people
would name some object and then turn towards whatever it was that
they had named. I watched them and understood that the sound they
made when they wanted to indicate that particular thing was the
name which they gave to it, and their actions clearly showed what
they meant, for there is a kind of universal language, consisting of
expressions of the face and eyes, gestures and tones of voice, which can
show whether a person means to ask for something and get it, or
refuse it and have nothing to do with it. So, by hearing words
arranged in various phrases and constantly repeated, I gradually
pieced together what they stood for, and when my tongue had
mastered the pronunciation, I began to express my wishes by means
of them. In this way I made my wants known to my family and they
made theirs known to me, and I took a further step into the stormy
life of human society, although I was still subject to the authority of
my parents and the will of my elders.

### 9

But, O God my God, I now went through a period of suffering and
humiliation. I was told that it was right and proper for me as a boy to
pay attention to my teachers, so that I should do well at my study of
grammar and get on in the world. This was the way to gain the

## BOOK 2

### 1

I must now carry my thoughts back to the abominable things I
did in those days, the sins of the flesh which defiled my soul. I do
this, my God, not because I love those sins, but so that I may love you.
For love of your love I shall retrace my wicked ways. The memory is
bitter, but it will help me to savour your sweetness, the sweetness that
does not deceive but brings real joy and never fails. For love of your
love I shall retrieve myself from the havoc of disruption which tore
me to pieces when I turned away from you, whom alone I should
have sought, and lost myself instead on many a different quest. For as
I grew to manhood I was inflamed with desire for a surfeit of hell’s
pleasures. Foolhardy as I was, I ran wild with lust that was manifold
and rank, In your eyes my beauty vanished and I was foul to the core,
yet I was pleased with my own condition and anxious to be pleasing
in the eyes of men.

### 2

I cared for nothing but to love and be loved. But my love went
beyond the affection of one mind for another, beyond the arc of the
bright beam of friendship. Bodily desire, like a morass, and adolescent
sex welling up within me exuded mists which clouded over and
obscured my heart, so that I could not distinguish the clear light of
true love from the murk of lust. Love and lust together seethed within
me. In my tender youth they swept me away over the precipice of my
body’s appetites and plunged me in the whirlpool of sin. More and
more I angered you, unawares. For I had been deafened by the clank
of my chains, the fetters of the death which was my due to punish the
pride in my soul. I strayed still farther from you and you did not
restrain me. I was tossed and spilled, floundering in the broiling sea of
my fornication, and you said no word. How long it was before I
learned that you were my true joy! You were silent then, and I went on
my way, farther and farther from you, proud in my distress and restless in fatigue, sowing more and more seeds whose only crop was grief.

Was there no one to lull my distress, to turn the fleeting beauty of
these new-found attractions to good purpose and set up a goal for
their charms, so that the high tide of my youth might have rolled in
upon the shore of marriage? The surge might have been calmed and
contented by the procreation of children, which is the purpose of
marriage, as your law prescribes, O Lord. By this means you form the
offspring of our fallen nature, and with a gentle hand you prune back
the thorns that have no place in your paradise. #For your almighty
power is not far from us, even when we are far from you.# Or, again, I
might have listened more attentively to your voice from the clouds,
saying of those who marry that they will _meet with outward distress, but I leave you your freedom;_ footnote:[1 Cor 7:28] that _a man does well to abstain from all
commerce with women,_ footnote:[1 Cor 7:1] and that 
_he who is unmarried is concerned with God's claim, asking how he is to please God; whereas the married man is concerned with the world’s claim, asking how he is to please his wife._ footnote:[1 Cor 7:32-33] These
were the words to which I should have listened with more care, and if
I had made myself _a eunuch for love of the kingdom of heaven,_ footnote:[Matt 19:12] 
I should have awaited your embrace with all the greater joy.

But, instead, I was in a ferment of wickedness. I deserted you and
allowed myself to be carried away by the sweep of the tide. I broke
all your lawful bounds and did not escape your lash, For what man can
escape it? You were always present, angry and merciful at once,
strewing the pangs of bitterness over all my lawless pleasures to lead
me on to look for others unallied with pain. You meant me to find
them nowhere but in yourself, O Lord, for you teach us by inflicting
pain,footnote:[Psalm 94:20] you smite so that you may heal,footnote:[Deut 32:39] and you kill us so that we may
not die away from you. Where was I then and how far was I banished
from the bliss of your house in that sixteenth year of my life? This was
the age at which the frenzy gripped me and I surrendered myself
entirely to lust, which your law forbids but human hearts are not
ashamed to sanction. My family made no effort to save me from my
fall by marriage. #Their only concern was that I should learn how to
make a good speech and how to persuade others by my words.#

### 3

In the same year my studies were interrupted. I had already begun to
go to the near-by town of Madaura to study literature and the art of
public speaking, but I was brought back home while my father, a
modest citizen of Thagaste whose determination was greater than his
means, saved up the money to send me farther afield to Carthage. I
need not tell all this to you, my God, but in your presence I tell it to
my own kind, to those other men, however few, who may perhaps
pick up this book. And I tell it so that I and all who read my words
may realize the depths from which we are to cry to you. Your ears will
surely listen to the cry of a penitent heart which lives the life of faith.

No one had anything but praise for my father who, despite his
slender resources, was ready to provide his son with all that was
needed to enable him to travel so far for the purpose of study. Many
of our townsmen, far richer than my father, went to no such trouble
for their children’s sake. Yet this same father of mine took no trouble
at all to see how I was growing in your sight or whether I was chaste
or not. He cared only that I should have a fertile tongue, leaving my
heart to bear none of your fruits, my God, though you are the only
Master, true and good, of its husbandry.

In the meanwhile, during my sixteenth year, the narrow means of
my family obliged me to leave school and live idly at home with my
parents. The brambles of lust grew high above my head and there was
no one to root them out, certainly not my father. One day at the
public baths he saw the signs of active virility coming to life in me
and this was enough to make him relish the thought of having grandchildren, He was happy to tell my mother about it, for his happiness
‘was due to the intoxication which causes the world to forget you, its
Creator, and to love the things you have created instead of loving
you, because the world is drunk with the invisible wine of its own
perverted, earthbound will. But in my mother’s heart you had
already begun to build your temple and laid the foundations of your
holy dwelling, while my father was still a catechumen and a new one
at that. So, in her piety, she became alarmed and apprehensive, and
although I had not yet been baptized, she began to dread that I might
follow in the crooked path of those who do not keep their eyes on
you but turn their backs instead.

How presumptuous it was of me to say that you were silent, my
God, when I drifted farther and farther away from you! Can it be
true that you said nothing to me at that time? Surely the words which
rang in my ears, spoken by your faithful servant, my mother, could
have come from none but you? Yet none of them sank into my heart
to make me do as you said. I well remember what her wishes were
and how she most earnestly warned me not to commit fornication and
above all not to seduce any man’s wife. It all seemed womanish advice
to me and I should have blushed to accept it. Yet the words were
yours, though I did not know it. I thought that you were silent and
that she was speaking, but all the while you were speaking to me
through her, and when I disregarded her, your handmaid, I was 
disregarding you, though I was both her son and your servant. But I did
this unawares and continued headlong on my way. #I was so blind to
the truth that among my companions I was ashamed to be less dissolute than they were.# 
For I heard them bragging of their depravity,
and the greater the sin the more they gloried in it, so that I took
pleasure in the same vices not only for the enjoyment of what I did,
but also for the applause I won.

Nothing deserves to be despised more than vice; yet I gave in more
and more to vice simply in order not to be despised. If I had not
sinned enough to rival other sinners, I used to pretend that I had done
things I had not done at all, because I was afraid that innocence would
be taken for cowardice and chastity for weakness. These were the
companions with whom I walked the streets of Babylon. I wallowed
in its mire as if it were made of spices and precious ointments, and to
fix me all the faster in the very depths of sin the unseen enemy trod
me underfoot and enticed me to himself, because I was an easy prey:
for his seductions. For even my mother, who by now had escaped
from the centre of Babylon, though she still loitered in its outskirts,
did not act upon what she had heard about me from her husband
with the same earnestness as she had advised me about chastity. She
saw that I was already infected with a disease that would become
dangerous later on, but if the growth of my passions could not be cut
back to the quick, she did not think it right to restrict them to the
bounds of married love. This was because she was afraid that the
bonds of marriage might be a hindrance to my hopes for the future 
not of course the hope of the life to come, which she reposed in you,
but my hopes of success at my studies. Both my parents were unduly
eager for me to learn, my father because he gave next to no thought to
you and only shallow thought to me, and my mother because she
thought that the usual course of study would certainly not hinder me,
but would even help me, in my approach to you. To the best of my
memory this is how I construe the characters of my parents. Furthermore, 
I was given a free rein to amuse myself beyond the strict limits
of discipline, so that I lost myself in many kinds of evil ways, in all of
which a pall of darkness hung between me and the bright light of your
truth, my God. What malice proceeded from my pampered heart! footnote:[Psalm 73:7]

It is certain, O Lord, that theft is punished by your law, the law that
is written in men’s hearts and cannot be erased however sinful they
are. For no thief can bear that another thief should steal from him,
even if he is rich and the other is driven to it by want. Yet I was
willing to steal, and steal I did, although I was not compelled by any
lack, unless it were the lack of a sense of justice or a distaste for what
was right and a greedy love of doing wrong. For of what I stole I
already had plenty, and much better at that, and I had no wish to
enjoy the things I coveted by stealing, but only to enjoy the theft itself
and the sin. There was a pear-tree near our vineyard, loaded with
fruit that was attractive neither to look at nor to taste. Late one night a
band of ruffians, myself included, went off to shake down the fruit
and carry it away, for we had continued our games out of doors
until well after dark, as was our pernicious habit. We took away an
enormous quantity of pears, not to eat them ourselves, but simply to
throw them to the pigs. Perhaps we ate some of them, but our real
pleasure consisted in doing something that was forbidden.

Look into my heart, O God, the same heart on which you took
pity when it was in the depths of the abyss. Let my heart now tell you
what prompted me to do wrong for no purpose, and why it was only
my own love of mischief that made me do it. The evil in me was
foul, but I loved it. I loved my own perdition and my own faults, not
the things for which I committed wrong, but the wrong itself. My
soul was vicious and broke away from your safe keeping to seek its
own destruction, looking for no profit in disgrace but only for disgrace itself.

The eye is attracted by beautiful objects, by gold and silver and all
such things. There is great pleasure, too, in feeling something agreeable to the touch, 
and material things have various qualities to please
each of the other senses. Again, it is gratifying to be held in esteem by
other men and to have the power of giving them orders and gaining
the mastery over them. This is also the reason why revenge is sweet.
But our ambition to obtain all these things must not lead us astray
from you, O Lord, nor must we depart from what your law allows.
The life we live on earth has its own attractions as well, because it has
a certain beauty of its own in harmony with all the rest of this world’s
beauty. Friendship among men, too, is a delightful bond, uniting
many souls in one. All these things and their like can be occasions of
sin because, good though they are, they are of the lowest order of
good, and if we are too much tempted by them we abandon those
higher and better things, your truth, your law, and you yourself, O
Lord our God. For these earthly things, too, can give joy, though not
such joy as my God, who made them all, can give, because 
_honest men will rejoice in the Lord; upright hearts will not boast in vain!_ footnote:[Psalm 64:10]

When there is an inquiry to discover why a crime has been committed, 
normally no one is satisfied until it has been shown that the
motive might have been either the desire of gaining, or the fear of
losing, one of those good things which I said were of the lowest order.
For such things are attractive and have beauty, although they are
paltry trifles in comparison with the worth of God’s blessed treasures,
A man commits murder and we ask the reason. He did it because he
wanted his victim’s wife or estates for himself, or so that he might
live on the proceeds of robbery, or because he was afraid that the
other might defraud him of something, or because he had been
wronged and was burning for revenge. Surely no one would believe
that he would commit murder for no reason but the sheer delight of
killing? Sallust tells us that Catiline was a man of insane ferocity, ‘who
chose to be cruel and vicious without apparent reason’; footnote:[Sallust, Catilina xvi]
but we are also told that his purpose was ‘not to allow his men to lose heart or
waste their skill through lack of practice’. footnote:[Sallust, Catilina xvi]
If we ask the reason for
this, it is obvious that he meant that once he had made himself
master of the government by means of this continual violence, he
would obtain honour, power, and wealth and would no longer go in
fear of the law because of his crimes or have to face difficulties through
lack of funds. So even Catiline did not love crime for crime’s sake. He
loved something quite different, for the sake of which he committed
his crimes.

If the crime of theft which I committed that night as a boy of sixteen
were a living thing, I could speak to it and ask what it was that, to my
shame, I loved in it. I had no beauty because it was a robbery. It is
true that the pears which we stole had beauty, because they were
created by you, the good God, who are the most beautiful of all
beings and the Creator of all things, the supreme Good and my own
true Good. But it was not the pears that my unhappy soul desired. I
had plenty of my own, better than those, and I only picked them so
that I might steal. For no sooner had I picked them than I threw them
away, and tasted nothing in them but my own sin, which I relished
and enjoyed. If any part of one of those pears passed my lips, it was
the sin that gave it flavour.

And now, O Lord my God, now that I ask what pleasure I had in
that theft, I find that it had no beauty to attract me. I do not mean
beauty of the sort that justice and prudence possess, nor the beauty
that is in man’s mind and in his memory and in the life that animates
him, nor the beauty of the stars in their allotted places or of the earth
and sea, teeming with new life born to replace the old as it passes
away. It did not even have the shadowy, deceptive beauty which
makes vice attractive - pride, for instance, which is a pretence of
superiority, imitating yours, for you alone are God, supreme over all;
or ambition, which is only a craving for honour and glory, when
you alone are to be honoured before all and you alone are glorious
for ever. Cruelty is the weapon of the powerful, used to make others
fear them: yet no one is to be feared but God alone, from whose
power nothing can be snatched away or stolen by any man at any
time or place or by any means. The lustful use caresses to win the love
they crave for, yet no caress is sweeter than your charity and no love
is more rewarding than the love of your truth, which shines in beauty
above all else. Inquisitiveness has all the appearance of a thirst for
knowledge, yet you have supreme knowledge of all things. Ignorance,
too, and stupidity choose to go under the mask of simplicity and
innocence, because you are simplicity itself and no innocence is
greater than yours. You are innocent even of the harm which overtakes
the wicked, for it is the result of their own actions. Sloth poses
as the love of peace: yet what certain peace is there besides the Lord?
Extravagance masquerades as fullness and abundance: but you are the
full, unfailing store of never-dying sweetness. The spendthrift makes a
pretence of liberality: but you are the most generous dispenser of all
good. The covetous want many possessions for themselves: you
possess all, The envious struggle for preferment: but what is to be
preferred before you? Anger demands revenge: but what vengeance
is as just as yours? Fear shrinks from any sudden, unwonted danger
which threatens the things that it loves, for its only care is safety: but
to you nothing is strange, nothing unforeseen. No one can part you
from the things that you love, and safety is assured nowhere but in
you. Grief eats away its heart for the loss of things which it took
pleasure in desiring, because it wants to be like you, from whom
nothing can be taken away.

So the soul defiles itself with unchaste love when it turns away from
you and looks elsewhere for things which it cannot find pure and 
unsullied except by returning to you. All who desert you and set 
themselves up against you merely copy you in a perverse way; but by this
very act of imitation they only show that you are the Creator of all
nature and, consequently, that there is no place whatever where man
may hide away from you.

What was it, then, that pleased me in that act of theft? Which of
my Lord’s powers did I imitate in a perverse and wicked way? Since I
had no real power to break his law, was it that I enjoyed at least the 
pretence of doing so, like a prisoner who creates for himself the illusion
of liberty by doing something wrong, when he has no fear of punishment,
under a feeble hallucination of power? Here was the slave who
ran away from his master and chased a shadow instead! What an
abomination! What a parody of life! What abysmal death! Could I
enjoy doing wrong for no other reason than that it was wrong?

_What return shall I make to the Lord_ footnote:[Psalm 116:12] 
for my ability to recall these
things with no fear in my soul? I will love you, Lord, and thank you,
and praise your name, because you have forgiven me such great sins
and such wicked deeds. #I acknowledge that it was by your grace and
mercy that you melted away my sins like ice.# I acknowledge, too, that
by your grace I was preserved from whatever sins I did not commit,
for there was no knowing what I might have done, since I loved evil
even if it served no purpose. I avow that you have forgiven me all,
both the sins which I committed of my own accord and those which
by your guidance I was spared from committing.

What man who reflects upon his own weakness can dare to claim
that his own efforts have made him chaste and free from sin, as
though this entitled him to love you the less, on the ground that he
had less need of the mercy by which you forgive the sins of the
penitent? There are some who have been called by you and because
they have listened to your voice they have avoided the sins which I
here record and confess for them to read. But let them not deride me
for having been cured by the same Doctor who preserved them from
sickness, or at least from such grave sickness as mine. Let them love
you just as much, or even more, than I do, for they can see that the
same healing hand which rid me of the great fever of my sins protects them from falling sick of the same disease.

It brought me no happiness, for 
_what harvest did I reap from acts which now make me blush,_ footnote:[Rom 6:21] particularly from that act of theft? I loved
nothing in it except the thieving, though I cannot truly speak of that
as a ‘thing’ that I could love, and I was only the more miserable
because of it. And yet, as I recall my feelings at the time, I am quite
sure that I would not have done it on my own. Was it then that I also
enjoyed the company of those with whom I committed the crime?
If this is so, there was something else I loved: besides the act of theft;
but I cannot call it ‘something else’, because companionship, like
theft, is not a thing at all.

No one can tell me the truth of it except my God, who enlightens
my mind and dispels its shadows. What conclusion am I trying to
reach from these questions and this discussion? It is true that if the
pears which I stole had been to my taste, and if I had wanted to get
them for myself, I might have committed the crime on my own if I
had needed to do no more than that to win myself the pleasure. I
should have had no need to kindle my glowing desire by rubbing
shoulders with a gang of accomplices. But as it was not the fruit that
gave me pleasure, I must have got it from the crime itself, from the
thrill of having partners in sin.

How can I explain my mood? It was certainly a very vile frame of
mind and one for which I suffered; but how can I account for it?
_Who knows his own frailties?_ footnote:[Psalm 193:12]

We were tickled to laughter by the prank we had played, because
no one suspected us of it although the owners were furious. Why
was it, then, that I thought it fun not to have been the only culprit?
Perhaps it was because we do not easily laugh when we are alone.
True enough: but even when a man is all by himself and quite alone,
sometimes he cannot help laughing if he thinks or hears or sees
something especially funny. All the same, I am quite sure that I would
never have done this thing on my own.

My God, I lay all this before you, for it is still alive in my memory.
By myself I would not have committed that robbery. It was not the
takings that attracted me but the raid itself, and yet to do it by myself
would have been no fun and I should not have done it. This was
friendship of a most unfriendly sort, bewitching my mind in an
inexplicable way. For the sake of a laugh, a little sport, I was glad to
do harm and anxious to damage another; and that without thought
of profit for myself or retaliation for injuries received! And all because
we are #ashamed to hold back when others say ‘Come on! Let's do it!'#

Can anyone unravel this twisted tangle of knots? I shudder to look at
it or think of such abomination. I long instead for innocence and
justice, graceful and splendid in eyes whose sight is undefiled. 
My longing fills me and yet it cannot cloy. With them is certain peace and
life that cannot be disturbed. The man who enters their domain goes
to _share the joy of his Lord._ footnote:[Matt, 25: 21.] 
He shall know no fear and shall lack no
good. In him that is goodness itself he shall find his own best way of
life. But I deserted you, my God. In my youth I wandered away, too
far from your sustaining hand, and created of myself a barren waste.
