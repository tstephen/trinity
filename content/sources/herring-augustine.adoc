## 4 - The African Pilgrim

> We speak God’s wisdom, secret and hidden, which God decreed before
the ages for our glory. (1 Cor. 2:7)

One summer's evening in the year 386 a man sat in a garden in link:/pages/places#_milan[Milan,role=place]. From
Eden to Gethsemane, gardens had been the settings for some of the greatest of
spiritual dramas. Now once again the scene was set for the climax and resolution of another, but this time intensely personal, conflict. Having asked his
friends to leave him in solitude, this man, in his early thirties, his body
wracked with emotions and tears pouring from his eyes, seemed to be on the
verge of what we would now call a nervous breakdown. What had brought
him to this place in such a condition? And why was this small personal drama
to be of such significance not only for early Christianity but also for the future
history of the Latin West?

### The Restless Heart

Thagaste was a small provincial town in Roman north Africa, now called Souk
Ahras and in modern Algeria. About 200 miles from the Mediterranean, it was
on the southern fringes of the fertile belt whose produce helped to feed the
great city of link:/pages/places#_rome[Rome,role=place]. Here in the mid-fourth century a minor pagan landowner,
Patricius, married a Christian wife, Monica, and subsequently produced three
children, two boys and a girl. One of these sons, Aurelius Augustinus, born in
354, was clearly a boy of some intellectual promise. Educated in Thagaste itself,
and subsequently in the somewhat more prominent nearby town of Madauros,
at the age of fifteen this academic progress was temporarily halted for about a
year while his father sought for the funds to continue it in the far more prestigious, but expensive, link:/pages/places#_carthage[Carthage,role=place]. During these months of relative idleness the
boy had his first serious encounter with a garden. As part of a gang of youths he
stole pears from the orchard of one of his father’s neighbours. This adolescent
exploit was later to cause the mature man much spiritual questioning; he saw it
as a parable of original sin, his theft of the inedible pears a minor repetition of
the stolen fruit of paradise. But eventually the greatest landowner in Thagaste,
Romanianus, supplemented his father’s meagre means, and in 370 at the age
of sixteen he at last set out for link:/pages/places#_carthage[Carthage,role=place], the great port and regional capital
of north Africa, the only city in the West that could even begin to rival the
magnificence of link:/pages/places#_rome[Rome,role=place] or link:/pages/places#_alexandria[Alexandria,role=place].

Here over the next few years he was to make his first lifelong friendships,
engage in his first sexual exploits culminating in the taking of a concubine and
the birth of a son, Adeodatus, to discover link:/pages/people#_cicero[Cicero,role=person], and lose one religious faith
and find another. Technically a link:/pages/glossary#_catechumen[catechumen,role=concept], he had almost been baptized
when his life seemed to be in danger from a childhood disease, and he had
continued to attend the first part of the Christian Eucharist. His reading of
link:/pages/people#_cicero[Cicero's,role=person] _Hortensius_, however, both turned his mind to a more serious pursuit
of philosophy and reawakened his religious instincts. But, as he returned to
reading the Christian scriptures, his profound disappointment with their poor
style in comparison to the great classical authors, especially in the abysmal
Latin translations then available to him, led to disillusionment with the faith of
his mother. In 373 at the age of nineteen he experienced his first religious
conversion: to link:/pages/glossary#_manichaeism[Manichaeism,role=concept]. He was to remain a Hearer for nine years. The
claims of the Manichees that their beliefs were founded on reason, their repudiation of the Jewish scriptures, and their dualistic explanation of the problem
of evil, seemed to present better answers than Christianity to many of his
pressing problems.

By 376 he had completed his formal education and was now himself a
teacher in link:/pages/places#_carthage[Carthage,role=place]. His continuing religious questionings, however, were
leading to his first doubts about link:/pages/glossary#_manichaeism[Manichaeism,role=concept] and its ability to answer not only
his questions but also those of his closest friends Alypius and Nebridius. This
fresh disillusionment was compounded when the famous Manichaean Bishop,
Faustus, visited the city and was quite unable to satisfy these young intellectuals when confronted by their probing examination. link:/pages/places#_carthage[Carthage,role=place] in any case was
proving to be too restricted a stage for the fulfilment of their ambitions, and so
in 382 they set sail for link:/pages/places#_rome[Rome,role=place] and wider horizons. Here in Italy he would find
the patrons he needed among the wealthiest aristocrats of the Empire. One of
these, the prominent pagan senator, Symmachus, arranged for him to be
appointed as professor of rhetoric in the city of link:/pages/places#_milan[Milan,role=place], now effectively the
main centre of government in the western half of the Empire. He moved
there in the autumn of 384, eventually to be joined by Alypius, Nebridius, his
concubine and son, and his mother, Monica.

[#page-108]

Milan was not only the residence of the Emperor, however; it was also the
episcopal city of link:/pages/people#_ambrose[Ambrose,role=person]. Never before had the African encountered a Christian like him. From a wealthy aristocratic family, he had been elected Bishop
against his wishes in 373 while still an unbaptized provincial governor. Our
young African went to the basilica to hear him preach, initially more out of
secular interest, to experience a master of oratory, rather than for the religious
content of the sermons. But what he heard had a profound effect on him. Here
was a man of lofty social status, with an intellect and education to match his
own, who for the first time presented to him a spiritual interpretation of the
Jewish scriptures which not only satisfied him on an intellectual level but also
offered an effective refutation of their dismissal by the link:/pages/concept#Manichacans[Manichacans,role=concept]. link:/pages/people#_ambrose[Ambrose,role=person]
was also a thinker and orator who began to show him how the philosophy of
the Platonists could be used in defence of his mother’s faith, Under link:/pages/people#_ambrose[Ambrose,role=person]’s
influence he returned again to a study of the great followers of link:/pages/people#_plato[Plato,role=person], men like
Plotinus and Porphyry. In comparison to their sophisticated religious thought
the Manichaeans again appeared crude and inferior; God and evil began to seem
far more sophisticated concepts than he had previously conceived. Once again
he felt his imagination swept up into something far greater, just as he had done
all those years before when he had first read link:/pages/people#_cicero[Cicero,role=person]'s _Hortensius_.

Now, at the beginning of 386, he was on the one hand withdrawing more
and more into himself in an intense and emotional course of study; on the other
hand the world and ambition were calling. He put aside his lover of sixteen
years and became formally engaged to a girl of only twelve. Respectable
marriage was essential if he was to find promotion in imperial service. However,
sexual renunciation was not yet for him, and he quickly took another, if temporary, partner.

But this absorption in philosophy was not his only intellectual pursuit. A
prominent Christian priest, Simplicianus, eventually to succeed link:/pages/people#_ambrose[Ambrose,role=person] as
Bishop of link:/pages/places#_milan[Milan,role=place], introduced him afresh to the Christian scriptures, which he
now read in the light of Platonist philosophy; and indeed in the person of
Jesus the Logos made man, the ultimate goal and fulfilment of philosophy. Just
like link:/pages/people#_justin-martyr[Justin Martyr,role=person] more than two centuries earlier, he was now being led
ineluctably towards an acknowledgement of Christ as the final end in which
Hellenistic as well as Jewish thought ultimately culminated. Simplicianus also
told him of others who had taken this route before him, especially the great
intellectual Marius Victorinus, the translator of Plotinus and the leading light
of the link:/pages/glossary#_platonism[Platonism,role=concept] of his day. In old age he too had read the scriptures and had
become convinced of the truth of Christianity, had humbly gone through the
preparation of a link:/pages/glossary#_catechumen[catechumen,role=concept] and had been baptized.

His friend, Alypius, was also coming to a similar conclusion, if by a
somewhat different route. One day a fellow African had introduced him to

[#page-109]

link:/pages/people#_athanasius[Athanasius,role=person]’s _Life of Antony_, and told him that such a monastic community
actually existed just outside link:/pages/places#_milan[Milan,role=place], and further reported to him that others
who had abandoned the prospect of bright worldly careers had joined another
community in Trier. The friends were shaken by the concept of these men,
learned and unlettered alike, taking heaven by storm. His intellect now convinced, still our African resisted. By the summer of 386 the two parts of him,
his intellect and his will, were at war with each other. Like rising waters slowly
building behind a great dam, everything told him that a final abandonment of
his will to Christ was the only answer. That dam must break, but still it held,
though under intense and increasing pressure. The psychological strain of this
inner conflict led to even his physical health deteriorating, and he began to
experience repeated difficulty with his breathing. Would he ever find release
from this growing torment?

And so we come to the garden in link:/pages/places#_milan[Milan,role=place]. Here, sitting under a fig tree that
again echoed not only the distant tree of Eden, but also the pear orchard of his
youth as well, he sat in an agony of mind and body, nearing the point of
complete breakdown, and seriously contemplating suicide as the only possible
release. And then, suddenly, as if floating on the air itself, he heard a voice
singing, the sweet, innocent voice of a child, associated by everyone in the
ancient world with the pronouncements of oracles. He heard this angelic
voice gently chanting: ‘Pick up and read, pick up and read.’ The random
opening of a book, perhaps link:/pages/people#_virgil[Virgil,role=person] for a Latin pagan, the Bible for a Christian,
and reading the first sentence that the eye fell on was a common practice in
antiquity for finding miraculous words that would answer or resolve a
problem. Perhaps this was what he was now meant to do. He recalled how
Antony himself had resolved upon the ascetic life after hearing the words of
Christ in the Gospel, seemingly addressed precisely to himself.

Quickly he rose, brushed away his tears, and walked over to where Alypius
was sitting. Here he had left a copy of the letters of Paul. He opened the book,
and looked. Immediately his eye fell on two verses from the letter to the
Romans: ‘let us live honourably as in the day, not in revelling and drunkenness, not in debauchery and licentiousness, not in quarrelling and jealousy.
Instead, put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to
gratify its desires’ (https://www.bible.com/en-GB/bible/2016/rom.13.13-14[Rom. 13:13-14]).

At the reading of those words the dam finally burst and the waters flowed
into his soul and all doubts were washed away, and he had his first glimpse of
the great truth of the Christian God, that our hearts are restless till they rest in
him. Then Alypius followed his example and he too picked up the book and
read the next verse: ‘Welcome those who are weak in faith’ (https://www.bible.com/en-GB/bible/2016/rom.14.1[Rom. 14:1])
and saw these words as directed to himself. In those few minutes their world
had changed for ever. Alypius and the man we know as St link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] had

[#page-110]

completed the first stage of their Christian pilgrimage. Now they could turn,
to the next.

‘That began with baptism. In the dark early hours of Easter Sunday, 387, the
two friends and Adeodatus removed their clothes and walked down into the
baptismal pool attached to the great basilica in link:/pages/places#_milan[Milan,role=place] to hear link:/pages/people#_ambrose[Ambrose,role=person] invoke
the Holy Trinity over them. As they moved from death with Christ into his
new life, they were anointed with oil and clothed in the symbolic purity of
white garments. Then they were led with the other newly baptized Christians
into the basilica itself to experience the eucharistic feast for the first time.
Augustine would never forget the experience of being greeted by a shimmering sea of lighted candles held in the hands of the assembled faithful, as he too
moved from darkness to light, nor the inexpressible beauty of the chanted
hymns, a musical practice copied from the Greek East and introduced to
Milan by link:/pages/people#_ambrose[Ambrose,role=person] himself. By now all thoughts of respectable marriage or
brilliant public career had been abandoned, and by September, 388, link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person]
and his circle of friends were back in Africa, initially settling in Thagaste to
begin the first experiment in monastic living on African soil.

His mother had already died before he had left Italy. By 391 his son, Adeodatus, had followed her, as had his friend, Nebridius. Emotional bonds tying
him to his past were snapping, which made the new ascetic life of his litdle
community all the more appealing. But by now the site of this experiment had
shifted to the port of link:/pages/places#_hippo[Hippo Regius,role=place]. Here a preliminary foray to discuss the
possibility of founding a community there took a surprising turn when the
assembly at the Sunday Eucharist pushed link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] forward and demanded
his immediate ordination. Like link:/pages/people#_ambrose[Ambrose,role=person] and others before him, the Christians
of link:/pages/places#_hippo[Hippo,role=place] knew a prestigious catch when they saw one! This was now the
price he had to pay for a small house and another garden in which to re-found
his community. By 395 he had been elected the unwilling assistant to the
elderly bishop, and within a year had succeeded him upon the latter’s death.
Here link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] was to remain as Bishop of link:/pages/places#_hippo[Hippo,role=place] for the rest of his life.

‘We know so much about his life because he now composed what was to
become his most read work, the _Confessions_. This told the story of his early life
culminating in his conversion to Christianity. At the heart of this book was the
idea that his own experiences were a paradigm of what was possible for the
whole human race (_Confessions_ II, iii, 5), and that people find God only by
truly finding themselves first. Or as link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] was to express it in one of his
sermons: ‘Our whole business in this life is to heal the heart’s eye by which
God is seen’ (Document 10).

Yet the _Confessions_ is not a straightforward autobiography. It is unique in
the literature of antiquity, both as a masterpiece of artistry and style that helped
confound any lingering pagan doubts about the ability of Christianity to

[#page-111]

nurture great literature, and at the same time as a totally new and original conception. It was in part a description of that renewal and reformation in the
new creation of Christ which Paul had first introduced and which link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person]
encapsulated vividly in one of his letters: ‘Our Maker is our Re-maker’.’ But
the _Confessions_ also had some classical influences as well, most notably in the
philosophical soliloquies such as that of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, or in
the epic poem the Aeneiad of link:/pages/people#_virgil[Virgil,role=person] telling the story of the journey of Aeneas
from the ruins of Troy to the foundation of link:/pages/places#_rome[Rome,role=place]. link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person]’s journey,
however, was a spiritual one, and his agonizing over his separation from God
was at a great emotional distance from philosophers who thought that reason
alone could bring them near to the divine.’ link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] was rather the prodigal
son returning to a loving father, and his book owed as much to the Lives of the
Christian ascetics as it did to pagan authors for its literary precedents. It is also
a vast, extended prayer in which the reader, as it were, overhears a Christian
soul in dialogue with his maker. In that sense it is more a work of theology
than autobiography. Indeed, it can be read on so many levels that these
multiple readings can give it a very modern feel. Its themes of memory,
redeemed human nature and the grace of God working on individuals have
found echoes in a wide variety of later works, from spiritual autobiographies
like those of Teresa of Avila in the sixteenth century or John Henry Newman
in the nineteenth, to novels such as that by Marcel Proust or Brideshead Revisited by Evelyn Waugh. Not surprisingly it has recently been described as ‘one
of the most influential books of western European culture’.

### Controversies

In his own time, however, link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person]’s reputation was largely built on his
lengthy career as an apologist for orthodox and catholic Christianity, forged in
a series of disputes with opponents both outside and within the Christian fold.
One of the first of these was the contest with the proponents of the faith of his
first conversion, the Manichees. It was their explanation for the existence of
evil, their claims to be a religion of reason, and their rejection of the Jewish
scriptures which had initially attracted link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person]. What he gradually came to
see was that their analysis not only of divinity but also of humanity was defective: far too simplistic and unable to offer explanations for the complexities
and conflicts he felt within himself. ‘The Manichees had avoided the tensions
of growth on all levels . . . With all their talk of “setting free”, the Manichees
had no room, in their religious language, for the more subtle processes of
growth — for “healing”, for “renewal”. It was a static faith in stark contrast to
the potential dynamism of Christianity, one that left link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] feeling
trapped: ‘I had already lost hope of being able to advance higher in that false

[#page-112]

doctrine’ he wrote later of the Manichees in the _Confessions_, his own potential
for spiritual progress thwarted (_Confessions_ V, x, 18). As he was to discover,
their boast of reason dissolved into a series of complex myths, and their criticisms of the Jewish scriptures were easily answered by link:/pages/people#_ambrose[Ambrose,role=person] with the help
of link:/pages/glossary#_platonism[Platonism,role=concept] and the application of typology.

At the heart of the problem, however, lay their account of creation and
their explanation for evil. Their dualism, the idea that created matter was
inherently evil because the product of darkness, effectively absolved the God
of goodness and light of responsibility. But, as link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] discovered, this did
not really accord with reality as he had found it; creation contained much
within it which was manifestly good. Again it was the Platonists who began to
lead link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] towards a solution. For them, evil was effectively non-being.
From this he went on to argue that Christianity’s analysis was easily superior to
the Manichaean one. In its origin all creation was good because made by the
one supreme God of goodness. Evil had arisen not as a force in its own right,
but as a corruption of what was originally good, and the ultimate cause of evil
was sin, and the responsibility for sin rested with human beings, not with God.
Evil thus had no existence of its own; it is literally nothing.

Yet of their own free will human beings have chosen this path of corruption, and the only way back is to recognize that we are utterly dependent on
the grace of God, even for that primary initiative of believing in him at all.
Here Paul took over from the Platonists. What the grace of Christ offered
Augustine was precisely that growth, that dynamic re-creation of his nature
that he found so frustratingly lacking in the Manichees. And in a series of
public disputations and in his many writings, link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] presented them with a
stream of counter arguments based on a much more sophisticated analysis of
both God and humanity.*

A far more potent foe within his north African church was represented by
the link:/pages/concept#donatist[Donatist,role=concept]s, however. By link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person]’s day they had become entrenched, and
in some areas were probably in a majority. One of the reasons for his election
as priest and then Bishop of link:/pages/places#_hippo[Hippo,role=place] was that the non-link:/pages/concept#donatist[Donatist,role=concept] assembly in the
city felt intimidated by a dominant link:/pages/concept#donatist[Donatist,role=concept] presence, and they looked to
Augustine to use his intellectual skills to combat this. Both churches laid claim
to the title ‘catholic’, and so the debates in which link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] was to be heavily
engaged have become fundamental for the history of the struggle to achieve
the defining characteristics of that concept.

The link:/pages/concept#donatist[Donatist,role=concept]s presented one potential model of catholicity. In this they
claimed to be the legitimate heirs of link:/pages/people#_tertullian[Tertullian,role=person] and link:/pages/people#_cyprian[Cyprian,role=person], and thus appeared
to have the advantage of appealing to local traditions and feelings. Their
notion of catholicity was defined in terms of purity and exclusivity. They
made no distinction between the present, historical Church, and the future

[#page-113]

eschatological one that would follow the parousia. Among other things, this
view depended crucially on how certain passages of the New Testament were
to be interpreted. ‘His winnowing-fork is in his hand, and he will clear his
threshing-floor and will gather his wheat into the granary; but the chaff he
will burn with unquenchable fire’ John the Baptist was reported as foretelling
of the Messiah (Matt. 3:12). The problem was to decide when this ‘gathering’
was to happen. For the link:/pages/concept#donatist[Donatist,role=concept]s it was a present reality; they had already been
formed into a ‘gathered’ Church. This idea originated in their rejection of
those bishops and other clergy who had compromised with the imperial
authorities during the Diocletian persecution, and was extended to those
‘contaminated’ by succeeding them or collaborating with them, including
those outside Africa. Thus their concept of catholicity extended to the sacraments celebrated by these two groups; sacraments too had to be ‘pure’ and
uncontaminated by the sin of apostasy. A fullness of purity in clergy, people
and sacraments was thus the defining mark of catholicity for the link:/pages/concept#donatist[Donatist,role=concept]s.

Augustine saw in such arguments that same essential flaw that he had previously isolated in the Manichaeans. link:/pages/concept#link:/pages/glossary#_donatism[Donatism,role=concept][link:/pages/glossary#_donatism[Donatism,role=concept],role=concept] also left no room for growth,
either individually or collectively. Its ideas led once again to a static view of
the faith, deriving from its essentially defensive posture. link:/pages/concept#link:/pages/glossary#_donatism[Donatism,role=concept][link:/pages/glossary#_donatism[Donatism,role=concept],role=concept] ‘was immobilized by anxiety to preserve its identity’.’ What was the Church? Was it a
refuge, an alternative to the larger and impure society around it, or a vital part
of that society seeking to transform and redeem it from the inside? link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person]
took the latter view, and saw the Church as the vehicle through which
humanity could strive to recover its lost sense of unity consequent upon the
Fall. As such, the Church was inevitably going to be a mixture of saints and
sinners; the wheat and the chaff had yet to be separated. In any case, as link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] was frequently to observe, not all link:/pages/concept#donatist[Donatist,role=concept]s were that holy or morally
pure anyway.

The Church on earth was never going to be a monolithic structure, but was
rather in constant dynamic tension with itself and the world. For link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person]
the imperative of catholicity that flowed from this was growth and expansion,
both within the individual and in the wider community. People strove for
moral purity aided by the grace of Christ, and the Church ever sought new
members for itself. The link:/pages/concept#donatist[Donatist,role=concept] church was locked into the past and the
present; link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person]’s Church was one forever looking to the future. The logic
of the link:/pages/concept#donatist[Donatist,role=concept] argument was that catholicity would also be limited in space as
well as time, confined to its African homeland. link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] argued that that
confounded the very command of Jesus to his followers to ‘make disciples of
all nations’ (Matt. 28:19); catholicity by its very nature was universal in the
sense of being international and not the unique preserve of one people or
tegion of the world. In his own words: “The untroubled globe of the world

[#page-114]

judges those men not to be good, who separate themselves from the whole
world, in a particular part of the world.”*

‘And thus it also followed that if the Church was morally mixed, the validity
and efficacy of its sacraments could not rest on the subjective purity of those
administering them. Sacraments depended not upon the holiness of human
beings, but upon that of their originator, Jesus himself, the only person
without sin, who sanctifies the sacraments through his ministers. Thus the
validity of the sacraments of baptism and Eucharist, and the ordination of
those celebrating them, rested instead upon the objective holiness of Christ.
Once given, they could never be removed; baptism or ordination remained
valid whatever the precise ‘purity’ of the priest or bishop administering them.

It was one thing, however, to challenge the link:/pages/concept#donatist[Donatist,role=concept]s on the intellectual
level, quite another to combat them on the ground. By the late fourth century
they had long been a powerful and established alternative to the official, imperially approved Church in north Africa. link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] preached sermons
against them not only in link:/pages/places#_hippo[Hippo,role=place] but also in link:/pages/places#_carthage[Carthage,role=place] and other cities, he issued
a stream of writings, and engaged in public debate with their bishops, culminating in a great conference held in link:/pages/places#_carthage[Carthage,role=place] in 411, attended by 284 link:/pages/concept#donatist[Donatist,role=concept]
bishops and 286 of their opponents. The problem, however, was not so much
winning arguments as inducing link:/pages/concept#donatist[Donatist,role=concept]s to return to the fold. As they were
technically schismatics it was impossible to apply the imperial laws against
heresy to them until an Edict of 405 equated schism with heresy. The crucial
questions, however, were how far the imperial authorities should become
involved in any process of persuasion or coercion, and what form or degree of
coercion should be adopted. For many years link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] was deeply reluctant
to use even the mildest of physical force against the link:/pages/concept#donatist[Donatist,role=concept]s. However, in
the years after 405 he became convinced that mild coercion was not only
morally permissible, but also appeared to work empirically in the sense of persuading link:/pages/concept#donatist[Donatist,role=concept]s to abandon their church for his. Theologically he justified
this on the grounds that humanity’s fallen state required restraint, and that
biblical passages such as the one about compelling people to come in also
seemed to condone some level of physical inducement such as fines or other
economic sanctions (Luke 14:23). What he would never agree to, however,
was the use of either torture or capital punishment. But his attitude, however
mild in the context of his age, has not endeared him to later generations, and
he has sometimes been seen as the ‘father’ of the medieval Inquisition, and
selective quotations from his works were used as a justification for the torture
and execution of religious opponents during the Reformation. What is now
clear is that such accusations, or out-of-context employment of his ideas, are
clearly anachronistic, and would undoubtedly have horrified him.”

His combat with the link:/pages/concept#donatist[Donatist,role=concept]s secured link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person]’s reputation as a theologian 

[#page-115]

and controversialist within north Africa; what was to expand that into
international recognition was the controversy that was to occupy much of the
last years of his life, that with the Pelagian. But here his legacy is even more
mixed than that resulting from the link:/pages/concept#donatist[Donatist,role=concept] conflict. The issues at stake again
raised fundamental questions about orthodoxy and catholicity, but this time
centred on the moral condition of humanity, the degree to which our wills
have been affected by original sin, and the consequent need for divine grace.
Any reading of the _Confessions_ makes it clear that link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] viewed grace as
the essential element in the healing process needed to begin to restore
humanity to a right relationship with God. What did link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] mean by this
grace? As he conceived it, grace was ‘a supernatural aid personally granted to
the Christian through the essential and exclusive mediation of Christ’."° This
was a totally free and unmerited gift; as link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] himself wrote: “The grace of
God would in no way be grace if it were not in every way purely a gift.’

The British theologian, link:/pages/people#_pelagius[Pelagius,role=person], had severe doubts about this line of
argument. For him, human nature was nowhere near so corrupted and unable
to fend for itself as he assumed link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] to be implying. Genesis had
described a human nature originally good in its essence; but clearly humanity's
moral imperfections and failures could not be denied. link:/pages/people#_pelagius[Pelagius,role=person] effectively
argued that each human being was born into the same primal innocence as
Adam, but that over time each individual was constricted by the weight of past
habits and the corruption of society. Baptism restored the freedom of moral
action and removed the necessity to follow the example of Adam. Thus grace
was a useful aid in an individual’s moral progress, not the essential originator of
it and accompaniment to it.” link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] on the other hand argued that Adam’s
sin was far more fundamental for the human condition. Where link:/pages/people#_pelagius[Pelagius,role=person] saw
Adam as providing his descendants with a bad example to follow, link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person]
conceived of original sin as an inherited disease passed down the generations;
in the graphic words of John Henry Newman in the nineteenth century, ‘the
human race is implicated in some terrible aboriginal calamity’ from which no
human beings can free themselves.'* For link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person], the implication of the
link:/pages/concept#Pelagian[Pelagian,role=concept] argument was that we can attain moral perfection largely through our
own efforts: ‘If God has made you man, and if you make yourself righteous,
you are doing better than God has done!’ retorted link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] in one of his
sermons.'*

In link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person]’s view, the initiative always lay with God, a God who ‘makes
us righteous not through our own righteousness, but through his, so that our
true righteousness is that which comes to us from him’. True freedom was
not the state taken for granted so lightly by link:/pages/people#_pelagius[Pelagius,role=person], but only the final end of
a long process; baptism put you on the road to convalescence, it did not cure
you. ‘Men choose because they love; but link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] had been certain for some

[#page-116]

twenty years, that they could not, of themselves, choose to love. The vital
capacity to unite feeling and knowledge comes from an area outside man’s
powers of self-determination.’ Or in link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person]’s own words: ‘From a depth
that we do not see, comes everything that you can see.” This thing that we
cannot see, but can experience, is grace which can ‘lift our being up to the
Being of God, because it can lift our love’.”

So far, so good. But further problems arise when considering link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person]’s
doctrine of grace. To what extent is humanity free to resist the gracious initia—
tives of God? If individuals are not able to choose to reject God’s advances,
then what is left of human free will? To this link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] then posed a counter
question: what is free will for? Is the possession of free will the same as being
free? By choosing evil, humanity has effectively rejected God’s gift of free will
and it can itself only be recovered through the gracious action of God, for ‘if
the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed’ (John 8:36). For link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person],
the ultimate liberty of the saints is to lose the freedom to sin. But in so arguing
he remained clear that grace did not override human free will; humanity
remained free to accept or refuse God’s grace, but ultimately cannot defeat
God’s ends by so choosing. '®

This leads on to the further question: what are God’s ends? What is the
purpose and ultimate end of creation, above all of the creation of humanity?
What does God will for humanity? Here we reach one of the most fiercely
contested of link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person]’s ideas, that of predestination. Briefly, this asserts that
God has selected, or elected, only certain individuals for ultimate salvation,
endowing them with the gift of saving grace. As Peter Brown has commented,
this was a concept well suited to its time and place. Its emergence could clearly
be interpreted in the light of the exclusive nature of north African Christianity
going back at least to link:/pages/people#_tertullian[Tertullian,role=person], and ironically seemed to echo the basic
impulse of the link:/pages/concept#donatist[Donatist,role=concept]s in this respect. And it also clearly spoke to the context
of the early fifth century, a time of barbarian invasion and imperial disintegration in the West, where people would look for a sense of refuge, security and
survival in a rapidly changing world. In this interpretation Brown presents
perhaps one of the most favourable modern treatments of the origins of
Augustine’s concept of this doctrine.”

Other commentators are much mote critical. Serge Lancel, for instance,
sees the doctrine emerging as an extreme reaction on the part of link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] to
the ideas of the prominent link:/pages/concept#Pelagian[Pelagian,role=concept], Julian of Eclanum. And with it, he argues,
Augustine placed himself ‘on the frontiers of heresy’.”” Gerald Bonner sees a
paradox between link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person]’s concepts of divine love and divine predestination, one that he frankly admits he is unable to reconcile. As he remarks, few
modern theologians would maintain link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person]’s concept of predestination in
its full rigour." Bonner and John Burnaby are also in agreement in arguing

[#page-117]

that link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] was too much influenced by another historical context, that of
ancient notions of justice, punishment and retribution as practised by the
secular legal authorities.” And several commentators have noted that there
remained a fundamental scriptural stumbling-block to link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person]’s concept of
predestination.

In the first letter to Timothy, God is described as a saviour ‘who desires
everyone to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth’ (1 Tim. 2:4).
This idea of a divine desire for universal salvation seemed to contradict link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person]’s more pessimistic view of an elect only receiving the gift of saving grace,
and even in his own day he was heavily criticized in these terms by John
Cassian and other monastic writers from Gaul. Some modern authorities
remain as convinced as Cassian that link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] never succeeded in defending
his views adequately in the light of this biblical passage.” But at the same time
Gerald Bonner makes it clear that there is a distinction between this Augustinian doctrine and that of the Church; predestination, as understood by link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person], never became the official teaching of the Latin Church of his day, nor of
the Middle Ages, but remained no more than the opinion of a distinguished
theologian.”

A further distinction has to be drawn, however, between link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person]’s
concept of predestination and that of the sixteenth-century Protestant theologian, John Calvin. Technically, Calvin is supralapsarian in asserting that God's
decree of election, and by implication damnation, was made before Adams fall,
while link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] is infralapsarian, in that the decree is a consequence of the Fall
which God foresaw but did not compel. In addition, Calvin was to stress the
total and complete corruption of human nature as a result of the Fall, while
Augustine had defended the more limited extent of the disaster, humanity in
his view retaining something of the divine likeness in which it had originally
been created. For Calvin, goodness had died in humanity with Adam; for
Augustine, it was wounded but capable of convalescence.” Although at first
sight these distinctions may appear somewhat trivial, the significance and
implications are in fact far reaching and clearly set a gulf between the two
theologians.

### Two Loves

For centuries, educated Romans had quoted the famous lines from link:/pages/people#_virgil[Virgil,role=person]’s
epic poem the Aeneid reflecting the belief in the eternal destiny of their great
city and Empire:

> To them no bounds of empire I assign,
Nor term of years to their immortal line.?°

[#page-118]

As we have already seen, in 248 the Empire had celebrated the millennium of
Rome’s foundation, again seeming to reinforce this everlasting destiny. Even
when, in the fourth century, that Empire had shifted its religious allegiance to
Christianity, Eusebius had, in a sense, done no more than reinterpret the old
idea, He saw that destiny itself now subsumed into the larger picture of an
earthly Empire reflecting the eternal kingdom of God himself. Perhaps the
high-watermark of this concept of the eternal Christian Empire came in the
reign of link:/pages/people#_theodosius[Theodosius,role=person] I from 379 to 395. During these years paganism was
finally and definitively outlawed, temples were destroyed or secularized into
cultural monuments, the pagan revolt in reaction to these measures quashed,
and orthodox Christianity proclaimed as the only official religion of the
Empire. To many, even to link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] himself, it seemed that the future of their
Christian world looked bright.

But link:/pages/people#_theodosius[Theodosius,role=person] had come to power in the wake of a disaster, the humiliating defeat of a great Roman army at Adrianople, not at the hands of the
military forces of another great Empire, but by the barbarian Goths. Their
subsequent pacification by link:/pages/people#_theodosius[Theodosius,role=person] seemed to have reversed this catastrophe. But barbarian pressure on the Empire's frontiers had been building for
generations, and Adrianople can now be seen rather as the harbinger of further
disasters to come. More and more barbarian groups were being settled inside
the Empire, partly to offer protection to them from other barbarian peoples
pressing them from the east, and partly to supplement a declining population
in the Empire itself and so provide the legions with desperately needed troops.
As the ethnic composition of the imperial army gradually shifted in favour of
the barbarians, so more of their leaders attained high rank in that army. By the
early fifth century the writing was on the wall for those with eyes to read it.
Many of the western provinces of the Empire were now effectively at the
mercy of barbarian tribes whether external or internal, and the situation was
rapidly deteriorating from year to year.

Then, finally, the unthinkable happened. In 410 the barbarian king, Alaric,
at the head of a coalition of tribes supposedly in the service of the Empire,
besieged and then broke into the eternal city of link:/pages/places#_rome[Rome,role=place] itself, sacking and
ravaging it and its inhabitants. Following that, his army moved south down
the Italian peninsula driving further floods of refugees before it. The first ones
to cross the sea and arrive in the relative safety of north Africa brought news
that could scarcely be comprehended. It is almost impossible for us now to
appreciate fully the sense of psychological trauma induced by these events.
There is nothing in our more recent historical experience comparable to it;
the fall of Singapore to the Japanese in 1942 undoubtedly damaged the presumption of British invincibility in the Far East, and the collapse of the Berlin
‘Wall in 1989 heralded the end of Soviet domination in Eastern Europe. But

[#page-119]

these events are but pale and distant echoes of the catastrophe of 410. link:/pages/places#_rome[Rome,role=place]
was the symbolic heart of an Empire and culture that had lasted not for
decades or generations but which had endured for a millennium. The fact that
it was no longer the political capital of the Empire was not the issue; it was the
living, vital heart of a whole world that, until 410, had seemed eternal and
inviolable. Something sacred to all Romans, pagan or Christian, had now
been violated, and that by those very barbarians who link:/pages/places#_rome[Rome,role=place] had successfully
kept at bay for centuries.

Why had this happened? For many of the remaining pagans, the answer
seemed clear. So long as the gods of link:/pages/places#_rome[Rome,role=place] had protected their city, she had
been secure. Their abandonment in favour of the alien religion of Christianity
had directly led to this, the greatest of all disasters imaginable. Only with a
return to the worship of the gods could it be repaired.

Augustine shared with his fellow Romans that initial sense of shock when.
the news first reached him in link:/pages/places#_hippo[Hippo,role=place]. That other great Christian intellectual,
Jerome (c. 345-420), had written of his own reaction: ‘If link:/pages/places#_rome[Rome,role=place] can perish,
what can be safe?” A few weeks after the sack, link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] told his shaken
congregation: “The world is dying, the world is growing old, the world is
overcome with weakness, it has the gasping breath of old age’. But his
analysis of the reasons for this calamity differed from the pagan one, and he
believed there was an answer to Jerome’s question. link:/pages/places#_rome[Rome,role=place]’s sack was a punishment for the sins of humanity; and in another sermon preached in its wake he
compared humans to olives pressed to make oil, but with the spirit of
humanity now turned to pure oil in this pressing. Even in the midst of disaster,
he found reason for hope. ‘Do not lose heart brethren, there will be an end to
every earthly kingdom.”

In these revolutionary words lay the kernel of a great idea that had been
brewing inside him for some years. The sack of link:/pages/places#_rome[Rome,role=place] merely confirmed that
growing disillusionment he had been increasingly feeling for the Theodosian
concept of Christian Empire. In 412 he sat down to write what was to grow
over the following fourteen years into 22 books that we collectively know
as The City of God. Here link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] not only answered the pagan critics of
Christianity, but more significantly also presented a vast panorama, a vision of
an alternative to the Eusebian concept of the relationship of the heavenly and
earthly realms. For the Christian, argued link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person], ultimate citizenship did
not reside in any earthly state, even link:/pages/places#_rome[Rome,role=place] itself; the destiny of humanity lay
far beyond this, in the truly eternal citizenship of the kingdom of heaven. Our
lives on earth are but a temporary existence in which we are never really at
home, but aliens passing through, pilgrims in a foreign land. The only eternal
city is the city of God himself.

On one level there is, however, little that seems particularly original in

[#page-120]

Augustine’s thesis. The very title The City of God was itself taken from a theme
that appears in a number of the Psalms (Ps. 46, 48 and 87), and is repeated
again in the New Testament, especially in the book of Revelation (e.g. Rev.
3:12, 21:2, 21:10), and at a number of other points (e.g. Heb. 12:22; Gal.
4:24-6; Phil. 3:20). This concept of Christians as aliens with respect to earthly
states was one also found in a number of early Christian writers; link:/pages/people#_tertullian[Tertullian,role=person], for
instance, describing a Christian as ‘an alien in this world and a citizen of the
city on high — Jerusalem’, a concept also repeated by link:/pages/people#_origen[Origen,role=person], Clement of
link:/pages/places#_alexandria[Alexandria,role=place], Hilary of Poitiers (c. 315-68), Jerome and link:/pages/people#_ambrose[Ambrose,role=person].” In addition,
while we have seen that there was a Christian tradition of interpreting the
Empire in a positive light even before the conversion of link:/pages/people#_constantine[Constantine,role=person], always
alongside that was also a continuing counter tradition of seeing it in a very dif
ferent light. This began again in Revelation with the presumed identification
of a persecuting link:/pages/places#_rome[Rome,role=place] with the beast of chapter 13, or the harlot of chapter
17. This view also had its later proponents, such as link:/pages/places#_hippo[Hippo,role=place]lytus, who interpreted the Empire as a satanic imitation of the universal and eternal kingdom
of Chris
