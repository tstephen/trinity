## What is theology?

* Etymology...
  - Theos: God
  - Logos: Word or reason
* Talk or reasoning about God.

## A possible definition from Thomas Aquinas...

> Theology concerns itself with God and all things in relation to God.

## Climate Sunday service: To discuss...

* Where would you begin?
* What theological questions will you need to discuss to plan such a
service?

## Why theology?

* Ideas about God matter, because everything comes
from God, derives meaning in God, and is ultimately
for God.
* Truthful ideas about God speak truly about the shape
of reality.
* Distorted ideas about God distort the shape of reality.

## The Problem of Prolegoma

> ‘We can say “man” in the loudest tones...But this
does not mean that we say “God.”’
--Karl Barth (CD II/1, p.269)

## Theology starts with confession

> ‘Faith seeking understanding’

> ‘For I do not seek to understand so that I may
believe; but I believe so that I may understand.’
--Anselm of Canterbury (11th century)

> ‘Understanding is the reward of faith.
--Augustine in North Africa

## Where to begin?

* With a recognition...

> We ought to speak of God. But we are humans and as
such cannot speak of God. We ought to do both, to
know both the obligation and inability and precisely in
this way give God the glory.’
--Karl Barth, ‘The Task of Theology’

* God has REVEALED God’s self...
  - But where?
  - And how?

## Possible responses...

* The Bible?
* Human experience?
* Jesus Christ!

## Theology as an academic discipline

* Biblical studies
* Church history
* Historical theology
* Systematic theology
* Ethics
* Practical theology
* Comparative theology

## My own approach...

> Theology is rational reflection on the person,
nature, and works of God which is guided by the
witness of scripture, informed by tradition, and in
conversation with culture.
Primarily systematic

## Whose theology?

* Christianity is a diverse religious expression...
  - over time...
  - and over place.

## Whose theology?
