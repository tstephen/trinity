# The Cappadocians

## 6. The Cappadocian achievement

So far in this study something has been said about the lives and
achievements of the three Cappadocian Fathers, and of their
treatment of their cultural and theological heritage. Above all,
attention has been concentrated upon their reworking of the legacy
of link:/pages/people#_origen[Origen,role=person] and their reaction to the challenge of Eunomius. But
apart from this last point little has been said about the specific
contribution made by each separately and all together to the
doctrine of the Trinity and to Christology. In both these areas, but
especially the first, they had a lasting effect on the face of Eastern
theology. So, John Meyendorff’s account of the Triune God in his
Byzantine Theology begins with a quotation from Gregory of
Nazianzus: ‘When I say God, I mean Father, Son and Holy Spirit.footnote:[John Meyendorff, Byzantine Theology (New York, 1974).]
The essentially Trinitarian character of Eastern theism owes much
to the work of all three Cappadocians, and to an account of this
theology I now turn.

### 6.1. THE CAPPADOCIANS AND THE TRINITY

On 19 June 325, in the presence of the Emperor link:/pages/people#_constantine[Constantine,role=person], the
‘318’ fathers of link:/pages/places#_nicaea[Nicaea,role=place] produced the Nicene Creed, which affirmed
in quite unequivocal language the full deity of the Son. In order to
reinforce and expand its point the council introduced a word into
the creed, the meaning of which was then unclear and caused
subsequent generations much trouble. It said that the Son was
_homoousios_, or consubstantial, with the Father. But despite the

[#page-102]

apparent authority of the creed we hear no more about it until its
reaffirmation at the Western Council of link:/pages/places#_serdica[Serdica,role=place] in 342/343, seventeen years later. In the intervening period the strongest supporters
of the creed had found themselves expelled from their sees and
exiled to foreign parts, while the supporters of link:/pages/people#_arius[Arius,role=person] flourished.
Above all, Eusebius of Nicomedia became a favoured counsellor of
the Emperor, whom he baptized on his deathbed in 337. Far from
Nicaea being regarded as authoritative and as having said the last
word, synod after synod produced creed after creed in order to
secure some measure of unity in the Church. An impression of the
doctrinal industry and disunity that mark the period between 325
and 381, the date of the second ecumenical council, held at link:/pages/places#_constantinople[Constantinople,role=place], is afforded by the simple fact that it saw the production
of at least twelve different and sometimes contradictory creeds.

On the whole it can be said that the central aim of all parties was
to steer some sort of middle course between the position of link:/pages/people#_arius[Arius,role=person]
on the one hand and that of Marcellus of Ancyra on the other. This
means that though all agreed that link:/pages/people#_arius[Arius,role=person] had been wrong, if he
meant that the Son was not co-eternal with the Father, Marcellus
was no less wrong in denying any real and eternal distinction
between the Father and the Son. Cappadocian theology is an
attempt to interpret the central term _homoousios_ in such a way as to
insist on the full deity of the Son and of his eternal distinction from
the Father.

Basil’s own rise to theological consciousness can be dated with
some accuracy to a council held at link:/pages/places#_constantinople[Constantinople,role=place] in 360, when we
find him associated with the party of his friend Eustathius of
Sebaste, the so-called Homoiousians. The party had arisen in the
middle of the previous decade and tried to form a common front
against Aetius and Eunomius, whose insistence on the unlikeness
of Son to Father and proposed definition of the divine nature as the
Unbegotten or Ingenerate or Primal One has already been mentioned. At a synod held in Ancyra in Galatia in 358 Eustathius of
Sebaste, George of Laodicea and Basil of Ancyra had endeavoured
to rebut the views of Eunomius, by insisting that the Son was ‘like in
substance’ to the Father. Such a view of the matter may have
satisfied Basil for a short while, but not in the long term. We never
find him employing the expression ‘like in substance’ or _homoiousios_ with which to define the position of the Son in relation to the
Father. On the other hand we do find him adopting a more pluralist
position regarding the nature of God and of the relations within the
deity between the three persons. Indeed, much of Basil’s theological

[#page-103]

enterprise was to reconcile to the Nicene Creed those whose fears
had been roused by the interpretation put upon it by Marcellus.

For what did _homoousios_ mean? To the Fathers of link:/pages/places#_nicaea[Nicaea,role=place] it had been a convenient tool for disposing of link:/pages/people#_arius[Arius,role=person], who would never
have dreamed of so defining the relation of Son to Father. It very
clearly meant that whatever was affirmed about the Father must
also be affirmed about the Son, Fatherhood alone excepted. But
apart from this affirmation of equality of nature it is hard to say
what more was being stated. Marcellus of Ancyra, as we have seen,
thought that the creed asserted identity of nature _and_ of person. In
other words there was for him only one _nature_ (_ousia_) in the deity,
but also only one _person_ (_hypostasis_) there. In other words the
interpretation of link:/pages/places#_nicaea[Nicaea,role=place] turned on what precise relation was
assumed between the two terms _ousia_ and _hypostasis_.

In 362 the Emperor Julian, in an attempt to disturb the peace of
the Church, recalled from exile those bishops, among them link:/pages/people#_athanasius[Athanasius,role=person], who had been sent away from their dioceses by Julian’s
predecessor Constantius. link:/pages/people#_athanasius[Athanasius,role=person] seized the opportunity thus
offered him by summoning a synod at link:/pages/places#_alexandria[Alexandria,role=place] in 362. The
upshot of this was the _Tomus ad Antiochenos_ (_Letter to the Antiochenes_). It was a clever document, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irenicism[irenic] in tone and intention,
endeavouring to rally all to the creed of link:/pages/places#_nicaea[Nicaea,role=place], but permitting a
certain diversity of interpretation in its meaning. It states: ‘We
require nothing beyond the faith of link:/pages/places#_nicaea[Nicaea,role=place].’ As long as that is
asserted, together with the condemnation of link:/pages/people#_arius[Arius,role=person], it appears to be
a matter of theological niceness whether it be affirmed that in the
deity there are one _ousia_ and one _hypostasis_ or one _ousia_ and three
_hypostaseis_. This highly ecumenical document was designed to
teconcile the opposing factions in the Church of link:/pages/places#_antioch[Antioch,role=place].

Basil of link:/pages/places#_caesarea[Caesarea,role=place]’s central contribution to the theological debate
was to clarify or to attempt to clarify the relation between these two
terms. In his earlier work, the _Against Eunomius_ of about 364,
Basil is shy of the word _homoousios_, using it on only one occasion
(1.20), in connection with https://www.bible.com/en-GB/bible/2016/heb.3.1[Hebrews 1:3]. After his consecration as
bishop in 370, however, he appears as a stalwart supporter both of
Nicaea itself and of his own interpretation of the _homoousios_. In a
letter (210) written in 375 he puts forward his own position as an
attempt to find a middle path between polytheism and Judaism,
Arius and Sabellius. We must confess both community of essence
(_ousia_) and distinction of person (_hypostasis_), he writes, It is only in
_Letter 236_, of the same year, that he explains more precisely what
this distinction entails. Using a distinction which goes back to

[#page-104]

Aristotlefootnote:[Aristotle, _Categories_ 2B], the relation between _ousia_ and _hypostasis_ is likened to
that between general and particular, _koinon_ and _idion_.


> The distinction between _ousia_ and _hypostasis_ is the same as that
between the general and particular; as, for example, between the
animal and the particular man. Wherefore in the case of the
Godhead we confess one essence (or substance), so as not to give
a variant definition of existence, but we confess a particular
_hypostasis_ in order that our conception of Father, Son and Holy
Spirit may be without confusion and clear. If we have no distinct
perception of the separate characteristics of fatherhood, sonship
and sanctification, but form one conception from the general
idea of existence, we cannot possibly have a sound account of our
faith.

Here and elsewherefootnote:[Basil, _Letters_ 52, 125 and 214.] Basil offers us a model drawn from logic,
with slightly materialistic overtonesfootnote:[The Greek word used by Basil is to hypokeimenon, ‘that which lies underneath’.], in order to shed light upon
the mystery of the immaterial Trinity. The three persons of the
Trinity all belong to the same general category of Godhead; all are
therefore equally spiritual and uncreated, because all share in the
same nature. Yet this nature does not have an independent reality
apart from the three persons. We are not to think of God as
somehow distinct from the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. To believe
in God is to believe in the Trinity. In the Basilian scheme each
person of the Trinity can be thought of as a union of the general
divine nature and an individual characteristic, sometimes referred
to as a _tropos hyparxeos_ or way of existing. So the Father is as it
were a compound of divinity + Fatherhood, and so on for the Son
and Spirit.

Basil’s treatment of the Spirit calls for special comment, as we
have noted above in Chapter 3. For him, what makes the Spirit
distinct from Father and Son is his holiness or sanctifying power.
This is a constant feature of Basil’s pneumatologyfootnote:[For examples of the Spirit as pre-eminently sanctifier (_hagiazon_) see
_Against Eunomius_ III.2; _Letter_ 214.4.]. However, it
fails to show how within such a scheme the role of the Spirit within
the eternal divine life is adequately defined. For while Fatherhood
and Sonship clearly relate to the immanent nature of God itis hard
to see how Sanctification can perform this role. Sanctification
defines the role of the Spirit in his economic dealings with us. He
cannot be thought of as making the Father and Son holy.

A final mark of Basil’s Trinitarian theology goes back to the early
days of his controversy with Eunomius. He admits in Book 3 of
_Against Eunomius_ that there _is_ an order within the deity, with the

[#page-105]

Father as the source of being, the Son and Spirit as deriving their
existence from the Father. But though admitting the place of taxis
or order within the Trinity, Basil refuses to follow Eunomius in
inferring from this order a lessening of essential being and Godhead. Though the Son comes from the Father he is not therefore
any less than the Father. In holding this Basil set himself against
what can be called a tenet of link:/pages/glossary#_platonism[Platonism,role=concept], namely that the cause is
superior to the effectfootnote:[For the general axiom in Neoplatonism of the superiority of the cause to the effect cf. link:/pages/people#_plotinus[Plotinus,role=person], Ennead V.5.13.35; and for a discussion of the principle cf. Proclus, Elements of Theology (Oxford, 1933), p. 193 and E. R. Dodds ad loc.]. The pattern of descent from the Father as
source persists throughout the rest of Basil’s life, and flowers in his
book _On the Holy Spirit_, where the Father is the first cause of
everything, the Son the creator, and the Spirit, the perfecterfootnote:[Basil, On the Holy Spirit 16.38.].

Gregory of Nazianzus delivered his five _Theological Orations_ in
the summer or autumn of 380 in the church of the Resurrection in
Constantinople. Although the audience to whom they were
addressed was composed of adherents of the Nicene Creed, the
wider audience Gregory clearly has in mind are the Eunomians,
with whom he spars in the first and second orations, and the
Macedonians or Spirit-fighters in the fifth. Apart from a more
pronounced insistence on the deity of the Holy Spirit than we find in Basil, he owes much to and shares much with him. He inherits from Basil the two models of sharing a common nature and descent
from a single source. With the help of the former he argues for and
illustrates the co-equal deity of the three members of the Trinity; by
means of the latter he hopes to show how all three are nevertheless
only one God. In the fifth _Theological Oration_ (section 10) he
admits that all three are consubstantial, yet not three gods, because
all come from the same source, that is, the Father. This insistence of
Gregory that the source of the divine unity is the _monarchy_ of the
Father is often repeated. In the third oration, for example, he
writes ‘In a serene, non-temporal, incorporeal way the Father is the
parent of the offspring and the originator of the emanation’.
Slightly later in the same speech he states ‘So because they [the Son
and the Holy Spirit] have a cause [the Father] they are not
unoriginate’footnote:[Gregory of Nazianzus, third Theological Oration 2, 3.]. Even more clearly we find him writing in _Oration_
42.15 ‘The three have one nature ... the Godhead. The principle
of unity is the Father, from whom the other two are brought
forward and to whom they are brought back, not so as to coalesce,
but so as to cleave together.’

Although most of Gregory’s analogies support the general model
of a unity in trinity achieved by means of a hierarchical descent
from the Father, there is at least one passage which seems to derive

[#page-106]

the unity from a slightly different picture. In section 14 of the fifth
_Theological Oration_ he writes:

> We have one God because there is a single Godhead. Though
there are three objects of belief, they derive from the single
whole and have reference to it ... In a nutshell, the Godhead
exists undivided in separate beings ... It is as though there were
a single intermingling of light, which exists in three mutually
connected suns. When we look at the Godhead, the primal cause
and the sole sovereignty, we have a mental picture of a single
whole, certainly.

In this passage the unity of the Godhead seems to derive less from
the Father than from common sharing in the divine nature. Part of
the trouble arises because of Gregory’s fiexible use of the key term
_monarchia_, which in the passage just cited refers to membership of
the same class; but which in the passage from the third oration
referred to just previously clearly means derivation, from the
Father.

On balance, however, despite the odd passage from the fifth
_Theological Oration_, Gregory prefers the idea of a monarchy where
the Father is the source of order and being. He advances two
further analogies in the same oration, one derived from rivers and
the other from sunlight. Both are models of derivation, and so
satisfy him on one level, but both connote flux, bodiliness and
change and time, and therefore he finally rejects them. A final
model is that drawn from mental processes, and that also makes use
of a descending model. In this model Father, Son and Holy Spirit
are self-related even as mind, word and breathfootnote:[Gregory of Nazianzus, Oration 12.1.]. Such an analogy
had appealed to a variety of Fathers from link:/pages/people#_tertullian[Tertullian,role=person] to Gregory of
Nyssa, and slightly later to Augustinefootnote:[The ‘mental’ analogy occurs in link:/pages/people#_tertullian[Tertullian,role=person], Against Praxeas 7; link:/pages/people#_athanasius[Athanasius,role=person], Against the Arians 2.2; Gregory of Nyssa, Catechetical Oration 2; link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person], On the Trinity IX and X.]. It had the great advantage
over the stream and sun models of not depending for its effectiveness upon spatial imagery.

To link:/pages/people#_gregory of nazianzus[Gregory of Nazianzus,role=person] we owe one particular idea that seems
to be quite new. In his endeavour to evade the Arian charge that
the ideas of Fatherhood must be descriptions either of the divine essence — which would exclude the Son — or of the divine attributes—which would import accidents into the simple essence of the Deity
— Gregory produces in his third _Theological Oration_ (section 16) the
idea of relationship (_schesis_). ‘I should have been frightened by
your distinction, if it had been necessary to accept one or other of
the alternatives, and not rather put both aside, and state a third and

[#page-107]

truer one, namely that “the Father” is not the name either of an
essence or of an action, but is the name of the relation, in which the
Father stands to the Son and the Son to the Father.’ A relation is
neither an action nor a nature nor an attribute. It is, even so, real. It
makes the important point that the nature of the Trinity is not
simply constituted by the age-old characteristics of deity, like
omnipotence, goodness and eternity, but also and perhaps more
importantly by the _relationship_ of the three members of the Trinity
both to each other (immanent Trinity) and to the world (economic
Trinity). This idea has been explored by John Zizioulas in _Being as Communion_,footnote:[John Zizioulas, Being as Communion (London, 1985).] in which he seems to see the nature of the deity as
constituted by their mutual interrelationships. So helpful and so
powerful was this solution to the problem of the Trinity that it is
possible that the celebrated analogies of link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] in his _On the
Trinity_ owe something to it.footnote:[For link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person]’s possible dependence on link:/pages/people#_gregory of nazianzus[Gregory of Nazianzus,role=person] see On
the Trinity 15.20.38 and the note there in the Bibliothtque Augustinienne edition, p. 528.]

Gregory of Nyssa’s discussion of the Trinity occurs in several
contexts. Much of his time was spent, as we have seen, in defending
the truth of the co-equality of all three persons against the graded
Trinity of Eunomius. In doing this he used language which was
susceptible of a tritheist interpretation. So, for example, in his first
book _Against Eunomius_ (section 227), he had argued that the three
persons of the Trinity share the same divine nature, even as Peter,
James and John share in the same human nature. They are the same
as each other in point of nature, different in their individuality. His
apparent tritheism is even more marked in a letter ascribed to
Basil, but now assigned to Gregory, _Letter_ 38. The letter begins by
insisting on a real distinction between _ousia_ and _hypostasis_. After
explaining the meaning of the two terms in the human sphere, it
continues: ‘Apply this to the doctrine of God and you will not go far
wrong ... The notion of uncreatedness and incomprehensibility
apply in the same way exactly to the Father and to the Son and to
the Holy Spirit ... The difference of the hypostases does not
disintegrate the community of the _ousia_, nor does the community of
the _ousia_ confuse the particularity of the individual characteristics.’
Together they form a ‘united separation and a separated union’.
Another of Gregory’s colourful images follows, that of the rainbow. As the rainbow unites continuity of light and difference of
colour, so too the Trinity unites community of nature and distinction of person.

It is hardly surprising that Gregory, with the best intentions in
the world, by using language and images of this kind was exposed to
the accusation of tritheism. His dense argument in _To Ablabius: On Not Three Gods_

[#page-108]

is of uncertain date, but may come from the period
after the Eunomian crisis. It was in that period that he had argued
that the unity of the divine nature was parallel to the unity of human
nature; Father and Son and Spirit were like Peter, James and John.
The treatise begins with the account of some unknown critic
arguing that such an analogy implied tritheism. It is Gregory’s
intention to prove that it does not. His first argument is to suggest
that the word ‘God’ should not be used in the plural. For him ‘God’
is strictly not a class word at all. The same for Gregory is true of the
word ‘man’. He wishes to make the interesting and difficult observation that ‘God’ is neither a common noun nor a particular one but
transcends both. It is, he insists, above _physis_ and therefore not
open to the charge of being used in the plural. The aim of the
argument is clear, for if accepted it absolves Gregory from the
charge of possible tritheism. The difficulty in fully understanding
him arises from the fact that the distinction between the terms
_physis_ and _ousia_ is both novel and unclear.

The second argument in the treatise proceeds on the assumption
that we can infer unity of source from unity of action. By this is
meant the idea that if it can be shown that one action proceeds from
the three members of the Trinity, then the Trinity is the single
source of that action. ‘When we inquire whence this good gift came
to us, we find, through the guidance of the Scriptures, that it was
through the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Thus the Holy
Trihity brings to effect every operation in a similar way.’ In other
words, where there is only one action, there is only one agent.

A third attempt to counter the charge of tritheism takes the form
of an attempt to relate the three members of the Trinity together by
means of internal relationships. It is not unlike a form of the
argument already to be found in link:/pages/people#_gregory of nazianzus[Gregory of Nazianzus,role=person] and may
owe something to him.

> Although we acknowledge the nature as undifferentiated, we do
not deny a distinction with respect to causality. That is the only
way we distinguish one person from another, by believing, that
is, that one is the cause and the other depends on the cause.
Again, we recognize another distinction, with regard to that
which depends on the cause. There is that [sc. the Son] which
depends on the first cause [sc. the Father], and there is that [sc.
the Holy Spirit] which derives from the first cause through the
second.

[#page-109]

Slightly later on this dependence is defined in terms of relationship.

There is much here to remind the reader of link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person]’s analogies
for the Trinity. Gregory and he are both dealing with the immanent
Trinity. Gregory and he both use the notion of relation. Gregory
and he both see the Spirit as coming in some way from both the
Father and the Son. Where they differ is that Gregory lacks a
_symmetrical_ understanding of the way this procession takes place.
So link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] can write in _On the Trinity_ XV.xiii.29 what Gregory
never did nor could write: the Spirit proceeds _principaliter_ from the
Father, but also from the Son. Behind link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person]’s formulation lies
his conviction of the equality of the Son with the Father in all except
one feature, his Fatherhood. Apart from that they share all attributes equally, _including_ that of being the source of the Spirit. In _On
the Trinity_ XV.xxvi.47 link:/pages/people#_augustine[Augustine,role=person] writes that the Spirit proceeds
from the Father _principaliter et communiter de utroque_. The Western form of the Nicene Creed, ‘the Holy Spirit, who proceeds from
the Father and the Son’, is the direct child of Augustinian theology.
Even so, despite the evident difference in emphasis, the two
versions are much closer than is sometimes made out. For in
Gregory of Nyssa the Spirit does in a sense come from the Son, at
least coming through him; and in the Augustinian version the Spirit
does come from the Son, but principally from the Father. Attempts
have been made to erect wonderfully different ecclesiologies on the
base of this slender difference; it may be doubted with what
justification or success.

### 6.2 THE CAPPADOCIANS AND THE PERSON OF CHRIST

Attempts to understand and explore the mystery of Christ’s person
had, up to the Council of link:/pages/places#_nicaea[Nicaea,role=place], largely concentrated on asserting
what was meant by calling Jesus God. Little serious attempt had
been made to examine what it meant to call him man, or how the
two assertions about Christ, that he was divine and that he was
human, could both be made without breaking him in half and being
unable to put the pieces together. Solutions to the problem of the
unity of Christ tended in two opposite directions. On one side there
were those who treated the deity as primary and reduced the
human elements to a very secondary place. Members of this
‘school’ are often termed _logos-sarx_ theologians. The expression
derives from the prologue of the fourth gospel: ‘and the Word
became flesh.’ The tendency of this school is either to deny that

[#page-110]

Christ possessed a human soul, or to admit that he had one, but to
deny to it any independent power of action. By and large theologians who came from link:/pages/places#_alexandria[Alexandria,role=place] held such opinions, among
them link:/pages/people#_athanasius[Athanasius,role=person]. On the other side there were members of the
_logos-anthrõpos_ school, who came largely from link:/pages/places#_antioch[Antioch,role=place] and
insisted that Christ was fully human and had become united with
the Word at his baptism or resurrection or birth as a result of his
virtue and obedience, either actual or foreseen. For the members of
the former school the virtue of Christ’s life and work derived from
his divine nature, for members of the latter the power of Christ
resided more in his obedience and example.

In 361 a certain Apollinarius became Bishop of Laodicea in
Syria. He and his father had done much to create a Christian
culture in the East in response to the attempt made by the Emperor
Julian in 362 to drive the Christians back into a cultureless ghetto.
The two, father and son, had produced classical versions of the
books of the Bible. link:/pages/people#_plato[Plato,role=person] formed the model for the gospels; Homer
for the books of Kings and so on. In addition to these fairly
harmless activities Apollinarius the younger produced a version of
Christology which challenged the rest of the Church, and above all
the Cappadocian Fathers, to define their own positions.

Basil’s own relationship with Apollinarius has been the subject of some debate.footnote:[G. L. Prestige, St Basil the Great and Apollinaris of Laodicea, ed. H. Chadwick (London, 1956).] A correspondence between the two has been
preserved (_Letters_ 361-364) which, if genuine, suggests that Apollinarius had a strong influence on Basil’s Trinitarian beliefs. Later,
however, in 375, in a letter to Eustathius of Sebaste (= _Letter_ 223),
Basil denies having had anything to do with Apollinarius. By 375
Apollinarian views on the nature of the person of Christ had
become widespread and were coming to be regarded as dangerous. What then were they?

Posterity has not been kind to Apollinarius and we are forced to
reconstruct his views largely from the writings of his critics.footnote:[See Creeds, Councils and Controversies, ed. J. Stevenson, rev. W. H. C. Frend (London, 1989), no. 70.] The
central thrust of his position was to insist on the unity of Christ. But
if Christ were truly one, he could have only one leading principle,
or _hēgemonikon_. This leading principle Apollinarius asserted to be
the divine nature of the Word. But, if that were so, what place
could be found for the humanity of Christ, above all for his rational
soul? The answer given was startling in its simplicity: there was
none. None was needed, none was possible, none was there. For to
assert the existence of a human soul in Christ meant the denial of
any true unity in Christ. Again, if Christ was sinless, and he was,
and had to be so if he were to save us, then he could not have a

[#page-111]

fragile human soul, which everyone knew from experience as liable
to sin. The sinlessness of Christ derived from his being a vehicle of
the divine nature, which _could not_ sin. Unity and sinlessness were
the main props upon which the Apollinarian picture of Christ
rested. ‘If God had been conjoined with man, i.e. perfect God with
perfect man, there would be two, one Son of God by nature, the
other by adoption.’ Finally, ancient biology insisted that in conception the soul came from the father, the body from the mother. But if
Christ had no earthly father — and being virginally conceived he had
none — then he had no human soul. The arguments of Apollinarius
were very clever; he had a case which needed answering.

His old friend Basil has little to offer on the debate. In his _Letter_
261, written in 377 to the people of Sozopolis, he does indeed
discuss the person of Christ, though without mentioning Apollinarius by name. There he insists that Christ possessed a human soul
‘using a body’ which was capable of hope and fear and of growth in
virtue. To say otherwise would mean that one would have to
predicate the sufferings of Christ, both physical and mental, of the
divine nature — a move which would make God less than perfect. It
appears from this argument of Basil that his principal objection to
the Apollinarian doctrine is theological rather than anthropological. It ought to be rejected less because it tends to the denial of
Christ’s full humanity than because it implies his imperfect divinity.
The full humanity of Christ therefore appears as a device to protect
his deity. A like argument occurs in the second letter of Nestorius
to Cyril, in which he writes with clarity that the division of the
natures was necessary in order to protect the divine impassibility.footnote:[ Tbid., no. 220.]

Gregory of Nazianzus produced a full and elegant reply to
Apollinarius in his _Letters to Cledonius_. Here Gregory’s
understanding of the meaning of redemption, rather than the need
to protect a particular idea of the divinity of the Word incarnate,
led him to coin a phrase which sums up his (and the Church’s)
unhappiness with Apollinarius, and his own positive reply. ‘What
has not been assumed has not been healed’ (_to aproslēpton, atherapeuton_). The Word heals our human nature in Christ simply in
virtue of touching it. The implications of this elegant formula are
far reaching. To begin with there is some sort of identity assumed
between Christ’s humanity and ours. Secondly salvation is assimilated to healing, an idea which, for all its attractiveness to the
Greek mind,footnote:[The idea that punishment is essentially and solely therapeutic probably begins with link:/pages/people#_plato[Plato,role=person], Gorgias 477A and 480C; and is taken over by link:/pages/people#_origen[Origen,role=person], On Jeremiah 1.16; Against Celsus 4.72; On First Principles 2.10.4-6; it is Gregory of Nyssa’s persistent view in Catechetical Oration 8 and 26.] is not frequent in the Bible. Finally, the place of
healing is assumed to be primarily the created spirit or mind. The
mind is the place at which the union between the body of Christ and

[#page-112]

the deity occurs. ‘Mind is mingled with mind as nearer and more
closely related, and through it with flesh, being a mediator between
God and carnality.’ Here we are close to link:/pages/people#_origen[Origen,role=person]’s belief that the
human mind of Christ is the point of juncture between God and the
body.footnote:[Origen, On First Principles 2.6.3.] In several respects, therefore, link:/pages/people#_gregory of nazianzus[Gregory of Nazianzus,role=person] is
more Greek than is Apollinarius in his conception of the Incarnation, above all in his insistence on healing as the heart of divine
salvation and on the need for the divine in Christ to be related to
the bodily by means of something more spiritual.

Gregory of Nyssa produced two writings explicitly directed
against Apollinarius and his followers. This is in addition to his
treatment of the Incarnation in the _Catechetical Oration_. He wishes
to insist, against the criticism of Apollinarius, that, although Christ
possessed a complete human nature, he was still one person. Opinions about the nature of his solution have differed.footnote:[J. F. Bethune Baker, Introduction to the Early History of Christian Doctrine (London, 1903), p. 251, regards Gregory as basically Nestorian in tendency, while J. R. Srawley thinks Gregory’s theology ‘crude and tentative’ and of a ‘monophysite type’: ‘St Gregory of Nyssa on the sinlessness of Christ’, Journal of Theological Studies (1905/06).] Some
have seen in him a proto-Nestorian, others a crypto-Monophysite.
Others again find his theology ‘crude’ and with little power of
synthetic thought. With such a variety of interpretations and judgements it is not easy to form a conclusion that does justice to all the
evidence. It seems best to treat him as holding a two-stage Christology, relating to both before and after the resurrection — an element
in his teaching, as the _Catechetical Oration_ makes clear, of crucial
importance. This will mean that for Gregory Christ during his
earthly life was made of two distinct elements, a full divinity and
humanity held together in a loose unity, after a Nestorian model.
Gradually, however, the shadows in and of the cave of our humanity are dispelled by the presence within it of the divine Word,
until the work is completed on the cross. Thereafter, with the
resurrection of Christ, the two elements are so firmly joined
together that the divinity of Christ swallows up the humanity and
transforms it into itself. Gregory uses another of his striking images
with which to illustrate this second stage. Our humanity is like a
‘drop of vinegar mixed with the endless ocean’.footnote:[For humanity as a drop of vinegar in water, cf. Against Apollinarius: GNO II.1.126.] Thereafter it no
longer remains in or with its own properties, but takes upon itself
the features of the Godhead. No separate, independent nature of
the humanity of Christ remains after the transformation. If Gregory began his reply to Apollinarius as a Nestorian, he ends it as a
pronounced Monophysite. And what is true for Christ is also true
for the whole of humanity. We are made for transformation and it is
achieved partly in and partly by us in virtue of our being somehow
one with Christ and of our taking seriously the life of the Spirit. For

[#page-113]

by our serious co-operation in the life of virtue we realize in
ourselves what Christ has begun.

The most important contribution made by the Cappadocians to
the Christological debate comes undoubtedly from Gregory of
Nazianzus. He asserts the basic principle that if we are truly to be
saved we need to be saved at our point of greatest need. And that
is the human soul. He offers no account of precisely how our
humanity relates to Christ, and therefore of how the saving and
healing work is to be transmitted. But he does assert the great truth
that Christ our saviour must be fully one of us, and therefore must
possess a fully human nature.

### 6.3 THE CAPPADOCIANS AND HELLENISM

In origin Christianity was a Hebraic faith, which before very long
found itself obliged to express its beliefs in Greek. If the primary
motive for this shift had been missionary, it soon became necessary
for the Church to defend its particular mission and to expand and
explore it in an alien culture. The vast majority of the leading
bishops and thinkers of the Church came from Greek-speaking
areas of the empire, and the most celebrated writers, especially
those who came from link:/pages/places#_antioch[Antioch,role=place] and link:/pages/places#_alexandria[Alexandria,role=place], gave to the primitive Gospel a new complexion, if not a new substance. Whether
this development amounted to a change or a continuity has been
much disputed. The fact remains that by the fourth century the
Church had at least two centuries of Hellenization behind it, and
although, towards the beginning of this period, link:/pages/people#_tertullian[Tertullian,role=person] in the
West had protested against this alien wisdom, the majority of
cultivated Christians took it for granted that the marriage between
the Gospel and the Greeks was advantageous to the Church. It
provided forms with which to express convictions. If the intention
of the Lord was a worldwide mission (cf. Matt 28:19), then it is
hardly surprising that the forms of the converted world entered into
the life of the conqueror. When link:/pages/places#_rome[Rome,role=place] conquered Greece, it soon
found itself using the forms of the vanquished. The same was true
with the Gospel.

The three Cappadocians grew up in a world where it was
assumed that such a marriage of Hellenism and the Gospel was
both a fact and a necessary and desirable fact. Basil and Gregory of
Nazianzus received a university education at Athens between 351
and 356, and although Gregory of Nyssa received his learning from

[#page-114]

his brother Basil, his style and knowledge of philosophy were in no
way inferior to his brother’s.

Even so, the complacency with which they had all three regarded
the alliance between Christianity and classical culture was rudely
shaken by the School Law of 362, in which the Emperor Julian
forbade Christians to instruct in schools. The marriage which had
existed since the days of Justin and Clement of link:/pages/places#_alexandria[Alexandria,role=place] was
suddenly threatened with divorce. All three Cappadocians reacted,
with varying degrees of speed and vigour, to the challenge. Possibly
the most outspoken, because the most threatened, of the three was
Gregory of Nazianzus, whose brother Caesarius probably belonged
to the entourage of the emperor. His funeral oration on his brother
reflects a certain ill-founded anxiety about the effects on his brother
of this connection;footnote:[Gregory of Nazianzus, Oration 7.13.] but Caesarius remained a Christian despite the
anti-Christian fanaticism of Julian — a reminder, perhaps, that
Julian’s hostility may not have been quite so intemperate as is often
suggested. But, whatever the _actual_ intentions and methods of the
emperor, they elicited, after his death in Persia in the spring of 363,
two violent harangues from Gregory, _Orations_ 4 and 5, probably
delivered at the end of 363 or the beginning of the following year.
The former is very long and occupies 130 columns in Migne’s
_Patrologia Graeca_. This must imply that the speech was meant as a
pamphlet to be read rather than as a speech to be delivered. The
bitterness of the invective reveals the important fact that Gregory
regarded Julian’s law and actions as an attack not only upon the
Christian community, but also upon all that he, Gregory, held dear
— above all the marriage between Hellenism and Christianity,
which had informed his own life.

Julian’s legislation has been described as an early attempt to
create a form of sectarian education, with the Greek poets acting as
a sort of sacred text. He chose to regard the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_,
Plato and Euripides, as supreme works of literature, but also as
productions of a view of the world in which the good Christian
could not possibly share. Julian is in this sense a pioneer in his
refusal to treat these masterpieces of the past as simply literature.
The spirit that inspired them and the form they assumed could not
be separated. Culture and religion formed an organic whole.
Celsus, two centuries earlier, had made a similar reply to Christians
who had tried to marry pagan philosophy and Christianity. Julian in
362 tried to effect a divorce between the Gospel and culture. It is
therefore not hard to understand why it was that Gregory of
Nazianzus, most of all the Cappadocians, felt his whole position

[#page-115]

threatened by the School Law. Had he been assured of support
from his fellow Christians in the encounter with Julian he might
have felt more secure, but the Christian tradition _vis-a-vis_ culture
had never been monolithic. There had been many who had doubted
the wisdom and the desirability of using the wisdom and culture of
the Greeks. link:/pages/people#_tertullian[Tertullian,role=person] in the second century, and Jerome in the
fourth, had taken a very hostile stand on the subject.footnote:[Tertullian, Apologeticus 46; Jerome, Letter 22.]

Gregory, therefore, was defending himself against a twofold
attack, from Julian and from the enemies of culture within the
Church. His main strategy is to challenge the central contention on
which Julian’s position rests. The Greeks, he says,footnote:[Gregory of Nazianzus, Oration 4.102.] had tried to
establish a link between _to hellenizein_, that is, speaking Greek, and
worshipping the gods, and saw Christianity as characterized essentially by boorishness and exaggerated respect for authority. To this
twofold accusation Gregory replies that appeals to authority are by
no means restricted to Christians, and cites a well-known Greek
expression, _autos epha_, ‘He said so’, much in use among the
followers of Pythagoras. On the main issue, however, he merely
asks how Julian knows that the Greek language is a monopoly of
the pagans. Of course he admits that if _hellenizein_ included in its
meaning the idea of worshipping the gods, over and above that of
speaking Greek, then, in that case, Julian may be correct. But that
is precisely what needs proving. But if the word simply means
speaking the Greek language then it is quite beyond the competence of the pagans to make such unilateral claims about it.

Basil’s attitude to culture can best be gauged from his little work
_To Young Men on the Value of Greek Literature_.footnote:[St Basil on Greek Literature, ed. N. G. Wilson (London, 1975).] It is impossible
to be certain about the addressees or the date. A recent editor
suggests that the addressees were probably Basil’s nephews (and
nieces) and that the work dates from the last years of Basil’s life,
about 376 or 377. It lacks the bitterness of Gregory, and is very
sententious. His treatment of Greek poetry, above all Homer, is
highly moral. Homer is to be read only in so far as he is useful, and
by ‘useful’ Basil means ‘profitable for the moral life’. Much of what
Basil says owes a good deal to link:/pages/people#_plato[Plato,role=person]’s treatment of the gods and of
the poets in the _Republic_. He may also have known Plutarch’s _On Reading the Poets_. Basil’s attitude to Greek poetry is rather narrow
and disappointing. The Christian, he thinks, must use only those
parts of Homer which have a moral value, and leave the rest on one
side. He must be like a bee in his selectiveness, flitting from one
flower to another. There is no suggestion here that there is any
value in such poetry apart from the moral. Aesthetic considerations

[#page-116]

or the theory of ‘art for art’s sake’ seem to have no place in Basil’s
attitude.

Basil’s cautious approach to classical _culture_ is reflected in Gregory of Nyssa’s attitude to classical __philosophy__. On two occasions in
his _Life of Moses_ he addresses the problem of the attitude a
Christian should adopt towards the treasures of Greece. On the
first occasion (section II.37) he writes of the foreign wife of Moses
that ‘she will follow him, for there are certain things derived from
pagan education, which should not be rejected when we propose to
give birth to virtue. Indeed moral and natural philosophy may
become at certain times a comrade, friend and companion of life to
the higher way, provided that the offspring of this union produce
nothing of a foreign defilement.’ Shortly afterwards Gregory shows
what he means by ‘foreign defilement’. ‘Pagan philosophy says the
soul is immortal. This is a pious offspring. But it also says that souls
pass from bodies to bodies and are changed from a rational to an
irrational nature. This is a fleshly and alien foreskin.’ Further
examples of discrimination follow, which evaluate the contribution
of pagan philosophy, choosing some elements, not others. What
Basil proposed as a way forward for the Christian when faced with
Homer, Gregory does for link:/pages/people#_plato[Plato,role=person]. The second example derives from
the spiritual exegesis of the spoils of the Egyptians (cf. Exod 12:35).
The demand to rob the Egyptians of their valuable possessions

> invites those participating through virtue in the free life to equip
themselves with the wealth of pagan learning, by which foreigners to the faith beautify themselves ... We are to receive
such things as moral and natural philosophy, geometry, astronomy, dialectic and whatever else is sought by those outside the
Church, since these things will be useful [the same word is used
by Gregory as by Basil, meaning ‘profitable for the moral life’]
when in time the divine sanctuary of mystery must be beautified
by the riches of reason ... For many bring the Church of God
their profane learning as a kind of gift. Such a man was the great
Basil, who acquired the Egyptian wealth in every respect during
his youth and dedicated this wealth to God for the adornment of
the Church, the true tabernacle.footnote:[On the Life of Moses 11.115, 116; and on his brother Basil in GNO X.1.126.10.]

The moderate, somewhat guarded attitude displayed by the
three Cappadocians to the Hellenic tradition manifests itself in
several ways, which for the sake of clarity I shall divide into form
and content. All three of them used forms that they inherited from

[#page-117]

their education. Gregory of Nyssa used link:/pages/people#_plato[Plato,role=person]’s dialogues the
_Symposium_ and _Phaedo_ as literary models for his treatises _On Virginity_ and _On the Soul and Resurrection._ His account of the
creation of man in _On the Making of Man_ owes a good deal both to
the _Symposium_ and to _Protagoras_. link:/pages/people#_gregory of nazianzus[Gregory of Nazianzus,role=person] owes a
considerable debt in his poetry to the didactic poems of Hesiod and
Aratus, and in his style to the speeches of Himerius and, before
him, to Polemo. Basil is less obviously dependent on any one
author, though he may have kept up a correspondence with Libanius, under whom he studied before his departure for Athens.footnote:[Gregory of Nyssa, Letter 13.4; Socrates, Ecclesiastical History 1V.26.]
The styles of all three fit well into what we know of the general non-Christian literature of the period.

But though there are many formal elements which link them with
the contemporary world, it is their use of the world vision of the
ancient world that is more complex and more intriguing. All three
moved in a ‘platonic universe’.footnote:[Peter Brown, The Body and Society (London, 1989), p. 300.] The ‘Plato’ whom they knew
taught them that there existed an intellectual world of supreme
beauty and goodness, apprehensible by the mind, from which and
for which the human spirit came and existed. The human spirit or
soul was imprisoned in the body, into which it had fallen because of
some ‘sin’ committed in a previous existence, and the purpose of
life was emancipation from the constriction of the body by a process
of purification both moral and mental. To the realm of spirit
belonged the world of Forms or Ideas, at the summit of which was
to be found the supreme Form, the Idea of the Good, and beneath
it the lesser Forms, all conceived as static modes of reality.

Much of this general pattern had been already taken over by
Origen, and from him the Cappadocians inherited a good deal. But
although there is much continuity in their general approach, their
innovations within it are perhaps even more striking. The extent of
the revision can be seen by looking at four main areas: (a) God, (b)
the spiritual world, (c) anthropology and (d) evil.

(a) __God__. For link:/pages/people#_plato[Plato,role=person] and link:/pages/people#_plotinus[Plotinus,role=person] the supreme principle is rarely
termed God. The Idea of the Good or of Beauty or Absolute Being
is regularly ‘defined’ by link:/pages/people#_plato[Plato,role=person] as neuter, while in _Timaeus_ the
personal god looks at the impersonal Form as something superior
to himself. For link:/pages/people#_plato[Plato,role=person], value was superior to being, and immobility
to motion. link:/pages/people#_plato[Plato,role=person] would probably have considered a personal absolute as a contradiction in terms. link:/pages/people#_plotinus[Plotinus,role=person], likewise, rarely applies
the term ‘god’ to the One;footnote:[Plotinus applies the word theos to the Absolute One at Ennead VI.8.21.9; VI.9.9.16.] to make the One personal would have
meant a difficulty in applying any idea of absorption in it as the goal
of the ascent of the finite spirit. For the Cappadocians, however,

[#page-118]

the idea of God is regularly personal, even though the terms of
Plato are still applied to God. This fusion of personal and Platonic
occurs especially in the more ascetic writings. In the first of his
__Longer Rules__, for example, Basil writes that the supreme beauty is
the good: ‘the good is God. All desire the good [a possible reference
to the opening sentence of Aristotle’s __Nicomachean Ethics__], therefore all desire God.’ Gregory of Nyssa, likewise, in his treatise __On Virginity__, identifies the abstract object of link:/pages/people#_plato[Plato,role=person]’s quest in the
_Symposium_ with the God whose vision is promised to the pure of
heart at https://www.bible.com/en-GB/bible/2016/mat.5.8[Matthew 5:8]. Gregory distinguishes himself from Basil by
his greater reluctance to abandon the more impersonal language of
the Greeks. This feature of his writing is well illustrated by his
frequent use of the neuter __to theion__, when referring to the deity.footnote:[to theion as a designation for God is very frequent in Gregory: cf. On the Making of Man 5, 6; and the examples cited in the index to Srawley’s edition of the Catechetical Oration.]
A further respect in which, while retaining a belief in the
absolute nature of God, the Cappadocians substantially modified
it, was in their Trinitarian doctrine. They all believed that in some
sense the one God was not so simple as to exclude that one God
being three persons. In other words absolute unity and simplicity
were in their view compatible with threeness. Contrast this with the
simplicity of link:/pages/people#_plato[Plato,role=person]’s first principle, always the same without increase or diminution, or with the One of link:/pages/people#_plotinus[Plotinus,role=person], whose absolute
simplicity exceeds our experience of unity. Something has already
been said about the embarrassment felt by Gregory of Nyssa in the
face of the apparent tritheism of his belief in __To Ablabius__.

Plotinus did indeed believe in the existence of three ultimate
principles — a sort of Neoplatonic trinity of One, Mind and Soul.
This again might provide a model for a Christian Trinity, until it is
remembered that the Plotinian trinity is organized on a descending
scale, such that the higher is always superior to what follows. As we
have seen, built into Neoplatonism is the principle of the superiority of the cause to the effect. But this principle is consistently
rejected by all three Cappadocians.footnote:[Cf. note 6 above; and Gregory of Nyssa, Against Eunomius 1.270.] For both Gregorys the three
persons of the Christian Trinity share equally in eternity and
infinity and in being the source of being to all else. The fact that the
Son is derived from the Father, and the Spirit from the Father
through the Son, makes no difference to the character of their
deity. Here again, therefore, we are face to face with a strange
phenomenon. Both sides to the debate are at one in admitting that
in the divine world there exist three divine hypostases. Both sides
admit that it is possible to order these three in point of cause and
effect. But, while link:/pages/people#_plotinus[Plotinus,role=person] clearly supposes that the One is not only

[#page-119]

the uncaused cause of all but also superior to all, the Cappadocians
were at one in rejecting any subordinationism of this kind.

(b) __The spiritual world__. For link:/pages/people#_plato[Plato,role=person] the Idea of the Good was
approached by means of a subordinate world of Forms, called
__mathematica__. In other dialogues link:/pages/people#_plato[Plato,role=person] assumes the existence of a
_kosmos noētos_ or intelligible world, which contained the ideal
patterns of this world, in accordance with which in _Timaeus_ God
had fashioned the temporal order. These forms were thought of as
static, perfect and changeless. In comparison with this picture of
the upper world, though not with that of link:/pages/people#_plotinus[Plotinus,role=person],footnote:[For link:/pages/people#_plotinus[Plotinus,role=person] the upper world of Spirit, nous, is full of life and movement as at Ennead V.4.2.43.] the transformation wrought by the Cappadocians is remarkable. The divine world
of Forms is replaced by the divine world of angels. The Forms in
some ill-defined sense owe their existence to the Idea of the Good;
the angels are most definitely creatures of God and, more importantly, they are full of life. This transformation is too consistent to
be either freakish or accidental, and may go back to link:/pages/people#_origen[Origen,role=person], who
identifies the ‘waters above the firmament’ with the angelic
creation.

For Basil, indeed, a regular distinction is made between the
angels and the Holy Spirit, who is the source of their perfection.
‘Holiness is not part of the essence of the angels; it is accomplished
in them through the communion of the Spirit.’footnote:[Basil, On the Holy Spirit 16.38; On the Hexameron 2.5.] Gregory of
Nazianzus is a little uncertain about the perfection of the angels,
whom he describes in the second _Theological Oration_ as ‘pure
natures, unalloyed, immovable to evil, or scarcely movable’.footnote:[Gregory of Nazianzus, Theological Oration 2.31 and Mason’s reference.] The
reiterated affirmation of the mutable angelic nature makes Gregory’s difference from link:/pages/people#_plato[Plato,role=person] clear enough. The angels know the
divine splendour, but are still with difficulty capable of deserting it
in favour of something inferior. Although he does not make use in
so many words of link:/pages/people#_origen[Origen,role=person]’s doctrine of _koros_ or of boredom in the
presence of a finite God, he shares with him the conviction that to
remain with God is at best precarious. Gregory of Nyssa also
believes in the essential mutability of the angels, but for him there is
only one sort of movement now, that is movement upwards towards
God and nearer to him.footnote:[Gregory of Nazianzus, Theological Oration 2.31 and Mason’s reference.] Freedom from sin, and even absence of a
body, never lead to the face-to-face vision of God, whether for
human beings or for disembodied spirits. The whole subject of the
divine vision has been explored thoroughly by Gregory himself in
the sixth __Homily on the Beatitudes__, Though less optimistic than the
other two Cappadocians, he is at one with them in admitting the possibility or even the necessity of change in the world of the
angels. This by itself does distinguish all three from the Platonic

[#page-120]

conception of a spiritual world of changeless Forms. For them as
distinct from link:/pages/people#_plato[Plato,role=person] the Forms have become living beings rather than
static patterns of changeless perfection.

(c) __Anthropology__. link:/pages/people#_plato[Plato,role=person]’s conception of the human being is hard
to define. He is popularly regarded as the archetypal dualist as a
result of dialogues like _Phaedo_ and _Phaedrus_ in both of which the
soul is regarded as having fallen from a state (and place) of
contemplation of the Ideas, without a body, into a state of loss of
contemplation, with a body. In other words popular link:/pages/glossary#_platonism[Platonism,role=concept]
believes in both a radical distinction of soul and body _and_ the pre-existence of the soul. This fragile union of soul and body, though
characteristic of much of link:/pages/people#_plato[Plato,role=person], is not the whole picture. In
__Timaeus__, above all, a much closer union is postulated between
body and soul; there is no doctrine of pre-existence, and human
nature is treated as a sort of microcosm of the whole.footnote:[Compare link:/pages/people#_plato[Plato,role=person], Phaedo 80, 81 with Phaedrus 245ff. and Timaeus 81A, 88D.] This latter
view is much more characteristic of the Cappadocians than is the
more strictly dualist position. Even Gregory of Nyssa, who devotes
the first part of _On the Soul and Resurrection_ to a highly Platonic
analysis of the human soul, deals in the second part with the very
un-Platonic doctrine of the resurrection of the body. Further, as we
have seen, his account of the creation of man in his _Catechetical
Oration_ insists on the necessity of a body for human nature, and
later on his doctrine of resurrection is closely linked to the idea that
body and soul will eternally belong together. link:/pages/people#_gregory of nazianzus[Gregory of Nazianzus,role=person], likewise, in his second __Theological Oration__, also speaks of man
as a microcosm. There he speaks of the mingling of the mortal with
the immortal, of the necessary connection of intellect, the divine
part, and of sense.footnote:[Compare link:/pages/people#_plato[Plato,role=person], Phaedo 80, 81 with Phaedrus 245ff. and Timaeus 81A, 88D.] Finally, Basil, at least in his treatment of what
constitutes the image of God in human nature, does not seem to
follow his master, link:/pages/people#_origen[Origen,role=person].footnote:[Compare link:/pages/people#_origen[Origen,role=person], Dialogue with Heraclides 12 and 16 and Basil, Homilies on the Hexameron 8.6 and 9.5.] He locates the image of God in man
rather in the power to control than in any particularly intellectual
faculty. Doubtless the more populist version of link:/pages/people#_plato[Plato,role=person] remains as an
undercurrent throughout the writings of all three Cappadocians;
but the very fact that alongside that stress we also find a rather
different picture, hard to reconcile with the more common version,
even for a philosopher of the calibre of link:/pages/people#_plotinus[Plotinus,role=person],footnote:[Plotinus, Ennead IV.8.1, IV.8.8.] indicates a
dissatisfaction with ‘school link:/pages/glossary#_platonism[Platonism,role=concept]’. This greater sympathy for
the body may have come about through reading the _Enneads_ of
Plotinus, with whom the Cappadocians had some slight acquaintance,footnote:[For Gregory and the Cappadocian knowledge of link:/pages/people#_plotinus[Plotinus,role=person] cf. J. Rist P. J. Fedwick (ed.), Basil of link:/pages/places#_caesarea[Caesarea,role=place]: Christian, Humanist, Ascetic (Toronto, 1981), ch. 5.] but it is more probable that this revolution took place under
the influence of a deeper perception of the meaning for human life

[#page-121]

of the doctrines of creation, Incarnation and resurrection of the
body.

(d) __Evil__. For link:/pages/people#_plato[Plato,role=person] there was no Form of evil. It had no eternal
significance. He identified being with goodness and non-being with
evil. It became an axiom, therefore, for Platonists that evil did not
really exist and had therefore no place in the real or spiritual world.
Plotinus, too, in his treatise _On the Nature and Origin of Evils_ (=
_Ennead_ 1.8), argues that, though evil has some sort of existence, it
does not exist in the upper world of his three hypostases and is both
connected with turning away from the One and somehow connected to matter. It is not absolutely unreal but only relatively so.
Much of this reduction of evil to unreality had found a ready home
among Christian writers, above all link:/pages/people#_origen[Origen,role=person]. Basil, also, in his
sermon __That God Is Not the Author of Evils__,footnote:[PG 31, 329.] in his effort to
remove the responsibility for the existence of evil from God,
adopted a markedly Platonic stance. God is not the author of evil,
because evil does not exist. What appears to us to be evil is simply
appearance. It results from no action of God, but from our perverted wills, that turn away from God, through lack of interest in
him. The word Basil uses to describe this mental condition is __koros__,
boredom or satiety. It had been used by Origenfootnote:[Origen, On First Principles 2.8.3.] also to explain the
sombre phenomenon of the fall of the soul from its state of
primitive blessedness. In link:/pages/people#_origen[Origen,role=person]’s case this sense of boredom had
arisen, so he argued, from the inability of God to satisfy completely
the finite spirit. And this ‘inability’ on God’s part was a direct
consequence of the finite nature of God himself. It is instructive to
see Basil, who in common with Gregory of Nyssa had almost
certainly rejected the notion of the divine finitude and replaced it
with that of the divine infinity, continuing to use a solution of
Origen in order to account for evil in the heavenly places.footnote:[Brooks Otis, ‘Cappadocian thought as a coherent system’, Dumbarton Oaks Papers 12 (1958).]
Although neither of the two Gregorys uses this device as a way of
accounting for evil’s origin, Basil’s continuing use of Origenistic
theodicy is an indication of both the strength of link:/pages/people#_origen[Origen,role=person]’s system
even when severed from its roots and the difficulty of accounting
for the rise of evil. Gregory of Nyssa, indeed, rejects the Origenistic doctrine of __koros__,footnote:[Gregory rejects the Origenistic idea of koros in Life of Moses 11.232.] but retains the general Greek idea that sin
arises from ignorance.

A further ‘inconvenience’ of the conception of evil as non-being,
with which all three Cappadocians worked, was: What were they to
make of the doctrine of eternal punishment, once it had been
agreed that the triumph of God in Christ meant the death of hell
and all evil? As we have seen, this conviction of the ultimate

[#page-122]

triumph of good led Gregory of Nyssa to a doctrine of universal
salvation. For him the Greek teaching of the unreality of evil
resolves itself into a doctrine of the non-eternity of hell and of the
ultimate salvation of all, even the devil. For Gregory, therefore,
basing himself on https://www.bible.com/en-GB/bible/2016/1co.15.24-28[1 Corinthians 15:24-28], the only form of punishment is therapeutic. It is surprising that such teaching was not
condemned, though attempts were later made to erase it from his
writings. The doctrine of universalism was indeed condemned at a
much later date by the Synod of link:/pages/places#_constantinople[Constantinople,role=place] of 543;footnote:[For the canons of the Synod of 543, cf. H. Denzinger, rev. A.Schénmetzer, Enchiridion Symbolorum (34th edn; Freiburg: Herder, 1967), nos 403-411.] and the
slight suspicion that surrounded the name and works of Gregory of
Nyssa doubtless reflects the unease felt at his unashamed maintenance of this doctrine.

Basil and link:/pages/people#_gregory of nazianzus[Gregory of Nazianzus,role=person] were less wholehearted in their
universalism.footnote:[For a very useful conspectus of early Church teaching upon eschatology, cf. Brian E. Daley, The Hope of the Early Church (Cambridge,1991).] Basil, particularly, interprets the strictness of God’s
demands and judgements so as, in the last analysis, to rule out
the possibility of ultimate forgiveness. Both in the _Moralia_ and in
the _Shorter Rules_ the sin of disobedience is punished with unending
penalties. Eternal punishment can no more come to an end than
can eternal life. Compared with the austerities of Basil, Gregory of
Nazianzus looks very mild indeed. In his discussion of https://www.bible.com/en-GB/bible/2016/1co.15.28[1 Corinthians 15:28], which had been used by Gregory of Nyssa to argue to
universalism, link:/pages/people#_gregory of nazianzus[Gregory of Nazianzus,role=person] suggests the same conclusion,
though neither so clearly, nor so philosophically. In his fourth
_Theological Oration_ (section 6) he writes ‘But God will be all in all
in the time of restitution; not in the sense that the Father alone will
be, and the Son resolved into him ... but the whole Godhead,
when we shall no longer be divided ... and shall be entirely like
God, ready to receive the whole God and him alone. This is the
perfection to which we press on.’ His language is nothing like so
clear as that of his namesake. He does not say outright that _all_ will
be saved; that is only an inference we might draw from his language, simply because the subject of the sentence ‘we’ is unclear in
its precise meaning. Basil and link:/pages/people#_gregory of nazianzus[Gregory of Nazianzus,role=person], though
following the general Platonic picture of evil as somehow unreal,
are sufficiently loyal to the majority view of the Church as to insist
on or not to deny the eternity of evil and therefore of punishment.

The four topics chosen enable us to see at a glance what position
the Cappadocians took towards their Hellenic heritage. With link:/pages/people#_plato[Plato,role=person]
they shared the view that there exists a spiritual world, beyond the
reach of the senses, into which all are invited once the victory over
evil has been accomplished. If calling them Platonists is to say that
they shared this view, then most certainly that is what they were.

[#page-123]

But within this scheme they introduced (though neither uniformly
nor universally) certain highly significant modifications. They
modified the simplicity of the Absolute by their doctrine of a
consubstantial Trinity. They modified its impersonal character by
making it profoundly personal. The world of impersonal Forms was
replaced by a world of personal and changeable angels. The
imprisonment of the soul in the body had by and large been
replaced by a more unified version, in which the body was there
from the outset and would be there at the end. The major area of
disagreement among them is to be found in their treatment of the
end of man and the fate of the devil and of other evildoers. link:/pages/people#_origen[Origen,role=person]
(and link:/pages/people#_plato[Plato,role=person]) held to the view that punishment was essentially
therapeutic and would not last for ever. Gregory of Nyssa shared
this opinion, and his avowed universalism may explain his absence
from among the four great doctors of the Greek Church. Basil,
however, almost always holds the sterner view, believing in everlasting punishment. link:/pages/people#_gregory of nazianzus[Gregory of Nazianzus,role=person] is an uncertain candle
set between the two brothers.

## EPILOGUE

The Cappadocians lived through a period during which the shape
and attitudes of the Church were being forged, less in the crucible
of persecution, though they had to endure a little of that, than
beneath the smiles of imperial favour. By the time they were born
the council and creed of link:/pages/places#_nicaea[Nicaea,role=place] were already past events. Yet
neither the meaning nor the authority of the creed was assured. By
the year 381 not only had the creed become acceptable and
accepted to the majority of Christians; its meaning had also been
clarified, by the distinction between _ousia_ and _hypostasis_. Further,
the deity of the Holy Spirit had also been affirmed. For all these
achievements the Cappadocians were largely responsible.

The ‘domestication’ of the Church under link:/pages/people#_constantine[Constantine,role=person] and its
consequent transformation into a department of state had also
raised problems for the Cappadocians, especially when they saw
quite clearly that, for some not totally obvious reason, the Arians
had the ear of the Emperor. But, except in some of the letters of
Basil, the problem of Church-state relationships seems not to have
been a cause of great concern to any of the three. It was only in the
face of an anti-Christian Emperor, Julian, that the difficulty
became acute, above all with his attempt to reclaim classical culture

[#page-124]

for paganism. The year 362, therefore, proved vital for them, as it
forced them to work out a coherent Christian response to the
Julianic challenge. Their reply became in its own way classical, and
contrasts suggestively with the total divorce proposed by Julian and
endorsed by St John Chrysostom on the one hand, and the exuberant and uncritical enthusiasm for Hellenism displayed by Synesius
of Cyrene, the ‘Platonist in a mitre’, on the other.

Much of this book has been devoted to an exploration of the
spirituality of the Cappadocians, especially its modification of the
heritage of link:/pages/people#_origen[Origen,role=person]. How far Gregory of Nyssa, above all, modified
his inheritance has been fruitfully explored by Jean Daniélou and
Henri Crouzel, who differ in their assessment of the revolutionary
character of Gregory’s own contribution. One thing is certain.
Gregory’s defence of Nicene orthodoxy made him stress the otherness of God in a more marked fashion than we find in link:/pages/people#_origen[Origen,role=person]. In
this newly discovered ‘orthodoxy’, ‘faith’ plays a significantly larger
role than it does in link:/pages/people#_origen[Origen,role=person]. Gregory’s insistence on the divine
mystery made him less confident in the power of the human mind
adequately to explore the nature of God. Finally, for Gregory, the
life of moral perfection is never totally superseded. The demand to
fashion our lives on the pattern of knowledge achieved and on that
of God himself means that contemplation never replaces virtue but
always accompanies it in the endless striving to remodel our own
finite existences on the pattern of his infinite goodness.
