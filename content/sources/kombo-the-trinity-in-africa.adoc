## Abstract

The African pre-Christian experience of God has tured out to be the gate through which
Yahweh has penetrated Africa. This does not only mean that for the African Christians the
‘Trinity must emerge from _Nyambe, Nyame, Nyasaye_, and so on—as various African peoples call
God—but also that the Son and the Holy Spirit are now constitutive in the identity of those
names. In this case, confession of one God (monotheism) is not in the ‘common substanceessence’ terms of the Greco-Roman heritage, nor in the ‘monotheism as one-ness, non-divisible
essence’ in Islam and Neo-Platonism, nor as oneness in the sense of ‘absolute subject’ in the
philosophy of Idealism. Here, oneness of God is confessed in the context of the fatherhood as
contemplated from the point of view of the Father whose _NTU_ is split between the Son and the
Holy Spirit. The Father in this case is the ‘Great _Muntu_’ (God) who uniquely shares the Divine
_NTU_ with the Son and the Holy Spirit. In this mix of things, four things are noteworthy:
1) there emerges yet another way of thinking about God, 2) the Christian faith receives alternative
resources for renewal of the church, 3) assumptions of conventional theological thinking are
once again re-examined, and 4) Christians have an opportunity to use their own cultural identity
for God’s glory.

## Introduction: The Significance of African Christianity

Africa has a rather bad memory of its mission history, particularly the widely
held perception that it had no God—a perception that is not only ridiculous
but also formed the basic reason why African missionaries completely ignored
the African pre-Christian experience of God. At the World Missionary
Conference held in 1910 in Edinburgh, Scotland, on the theme ‘Missionary
Problems in Relation to the non-Christian World’—where four other world
religions were represented (religions of China, religions of Japan, Islam, and
Hinduism), it was roundly concluded that African religious life fit the description
of what E.B. Tylor earlier had called animism.footnote:[E.B. Tylor, Primitive Culture: Researches into Development of Mythology (London: Philosophy, 1891).] In other words, the 1910 Edinburgh conference confirmed the thinking at the time and joined the bandwagon in disparaging African religion as having no religious content and no
record of interaction with God.footnote:[
Scottish LMS missionary, Robert Moffat, had earlier published the following: "... Satan has employed his agency with fatal success, in erasing every vestige of religious impres minds of the Bechuanas," in Robert Moffat, Missionary Labours in Southern Africa (London: J. Snow, 1842), 243-44. Hastings argues that in the case of Africa, the missionary considered anything pre-Christian as harmful or valueless (Adrian Hastings, Church and Mission in Modern Africa (London: Oxford University Press, 1967), 60).]
This was a bad beginning in terms of attitude and facts. Its effects loom large even in our own generation.

With nostalgia, we read some of the most insightful engagements with
God in the works of such early church fathers as Justin, Tertullian, Athanasius,
the Cappadocians, and later Augustine. These fathers were not Jews, but their
profound sense of their own religious consciousness became the platform
upon which they engaged their new Christian experience. They were GrecoRomans and would use the infrastructure of that culture to express their belief
in Yahweh, the God of Israel, whom they had come to know in Christ. They
belonged to the Greco-Romans, but they had since converted. The God they
knew and worshipped was not _theos_ as he had been conceived by the Greeks,
but Yahweh of Israel. These considerations moved the church fathers to the
point that they joined Apostle Paul in his paraphrase of the _Shema_:

> For even if there are so called gods, whether in heaven ot on earth (as indeed there are
many ‘gods’ and many ‘lords’, yet for us there is but one God, the Father from whom
all things come and for whom we live, and there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through
whom all things came and through whom we live.footnote:[1 Cor. 8: 5, 6; NIV.]

The story of theological leadership in Africa resembles the experience of the
church fathers in many ways. Those given to reimagine and reconceptualize
the Christian faith for Africa often are either first or second generation converts. For them, the future of perceptive theology lies in retrieving the intellectual symbols in the African religious consciousness and redirecting them in
the service of God made known in Christ. This task means at least four things:
1) emergence of new and uniquely African ways of thinking about God;
2) exposing hitherto untapped resources for renewal of the church; 3) possible
conflict between emerging theological process and conventional theological
thinking; and 4) conflict between emerging theological process, on the one
hand, and African traditional religions and Islam, on the other hand.

## God Talk in Traditional Africa: A Platform for Engaging the God of Christian Worship

After all, the animism talk in African mission history was a mere caricature
and a reflection of the extent to which those who interacted with Africa at that
time, and therefore should have known better, chose to underestimate the
African sense of God. The 1960s and the 1970s saw a flood of religious literature by Africans and Africanists addressing themselves to this thinking. Some
of the well known and widely published rebuttals are seen in the works of
Bolaji Idowu, John S. Mbiti, and Gabriel M. Setiloane.

## Bolaji Idowu: One God Extends beyond Any Territory to the Whole World

Bolaji Idowu persistently affirms "the continuity of God from the African preChristian past into the present Christian experience."
footnote:[K, Bediako, Theology and Identity (Oxford: Regnum Books, 1992), 281, 284.]
In his mind, God cannot be confined in any way. "His realm is the whole universe. All peoples are
his concern. And he has revealed himself primarily to them all, each race
apprehending the revelation according to its native capability."
footnote:[B, Idowu, Towards an Indigenous Church (London: Oxford University Press, 1965), 20; cf
B. Idowu, Olodumare: God in Yoruba Belief (London: Longman, 1962), 31.]
Elsewhere, he writes: "God is One, not many; [...] to the one God belongs the earth and all
its fullness. It is this God, therefore, Who reveals Himself to every people on
earth and whom they have apprehended according to the degree of their spiritual perception,... as those who have had practical experience of him." footnote:[Idowu, Olodumare, 31.]
Appealing to the biblical witness, Idowu reasons as follows:

> On the basis of the Bible taken as a whole, however, there can only be one answer.
‘There is only one God, the Creator of heaven and earth and all that is in them; the
God who has never left Himself without witness in any nation, age or generation;
Whose creative purpose has ever been at work in this world; Who by one stupendous
act of climactic self-revelation in Christ Jesus came to redeem a fallen world."
footnote:[Tdowu, Towards an Indigenous Church, 25.]

Idowu sees God as central to African religious life. He believes that "in Africa,
the real cohesive factor of religion is the living God and that without this one
factor, all things would fall to pieces."
footnote:[B. Idowu, African Traditional Religion—A Definition (London: SCM Press, 1973), 104.]
He sees this one God as dominating the
whole of Africa. Indeed, he argues that the African proper names for God—
like _Yamba_ that occurs in parts of Nigeria and appears in the form of Yambe,
Yembe or Ndyambi in the Cameroons and the Congo, and as Onyame or
Nyame among the Akan of Ghana and the Nilotic peoples of the greater
Sudan
footnote:[Idowu, African Traditional Religion, 103f; B. Idowu, "God," Biblical Revelation and African
Belief; (London: Lutterworth Press, 1973), 26; E.W. Smith, African Ideas of God (London:
Edinburgh House Press, 1950), 157.]
—seem to be a variation of one name. A similar argument had been
raised earlier by E.W. Smith. Commenting on Nyambe, Smith had noted that
the name appears in:

> ...its various forms: Nzambi, Nyambe, Ndyambi, Dzambi, ‘Tsambi, Yambe, Sambi,
Zam, Monzam etc. This God's name is spread over a very large area of Western Equatorial Africa, from the Cameroons to the Northern border of Bechuanaland, and from
the Atlantic Coast to the middle regions of Belgian Congo... The name is used in at
least twenty-five versions of the Holy Scripture.
footnote:[Smith, African Ideas of God, 156.]

Idowu seems to be saying two things: 1) that polytheism is not part of Africa's
vocabulary, and 2) that the African people have identical yet distinct ways of
speaking about the one God. For Idowu, the variation of the same name
among different African peoples indicates that the story of God is one story
told by different African communities.

## John S. Mbiti: Pre-Christian African Interaction with God as _Preparatio Evangelica_

John S. Mbiti takes the view that pre-Christian Africa's interaction with God
was first and foremost _preparatio evangelica_. He demonstrates his point by
employing a series of metaphors that traditional African societies use to talk
about God. The metaphors he employs range from simple anthropomorphic
descriptions to theriomorphic and physiomorphic descriptions of the divine.
‘The basic premise of Mbiti’s message is that pre-Christian Africa and the early
Israelites had many commonalities. For Mbiti, this could mean that traditional
Africa shared the verbal context"
footnote:[Korpel defines verbal context as "the users’ sign-context that acts as a rule narrowing down
the meaning of metaphors and similes employed." See M.C.A. Korpel, A Rift in the Clouds:
Ugaritic and Hebrew Descriptions of the Divine (Munster: Ugarit-Verlag, 1990), 79.]
of the metaphors used to describe God with
the early Israelites. As far as Mbiti is concerned, pre-Christian Africa and the
early Israelites cherished the same God, used the same metaphors to describe
God, and systematized the concepts and metaphors into comparable theologies. To demonstrate his point, Mbiti isolates a large number of terms, metaphors, and similes that are used to describe God in pre-Christian Africa and he
uses them in a way that reminds one of the occurrences of the same symbols
in the Old Testament.footnote:[
Okot p'Bitek accuses J.S. Mbiti of pasting together bits and pieces of the ideas of God taken
from all over Africa. As far as p’Bitek is concerned, African scholars such as Mbiti, Idowu,
Danquah, Busia, Kenyatta and Sengor are "intellectual smugglers" who have draped the African
gods in "awkward Hellenic garments." He adds that "the African deities of the books... are
creations of students of African religions. They are all beyond recognition to the ordinary Africans
in the countryside." See Okot p'Bitek, Religion of the Central Luo (Nairobi: East African Literature
Bureau, 1971), 7, 46, 47, 50, 80, 88. My opinion is that pBitek’s criticism of Mbiti and
the other African scholars is unfair. Mbiti, like Idowu and Danquah, is simply interested in
demonstrating that the African peoples had something of the self-revelation of God. Moreover,
the notion of "pasting bits and pieces taken from all over Africa" assumes a fundamental diversity
of the African Negroes. This position is no longer in vogue. Modern anthropologists,
ethnolinguists, and African historiographers argue for fundamental unity of the African peoples.
See J.H.O. Kombo, The Doctrine of God in African Christian Thought: The Holy Trinity, Theological
Hermeneutics, and the African Intellectual Culture (Brill: Leiden & Boston, 2007), 1-7.]

He notes, for instance, that pre-Christian Africa viewed God as the
universal creator-father.footnote:[
J.S. Mbiti, African Religions and Philosophy (London: Heinemann, 1969), 39.]
He extracts this conclusion from usage of such metaphors
as excavator, hewer, carver, creator, originator, inventor, architect, and potter
that were fashioned by different African people in their description of God.
footnote:[J.S. Mbiti, Introduction to African Religion (London: Heinemann, 1975), 44.]
From these metaphors, Mbiti hears the African people saying that God alone
is the unfathered Father; he is the one who fathered the world, owns it, and
cares for it.

In respect to his essence, Mbiti notes that pre-Christian Africa perceived
God as a spiritual being that does not have a material body. As such, some
people simply call him "the Great Spirit, the Fathomless Spirit, the
Ever-Present Spirit or the God of Wind and Breath."
footnote:[S Mbiti, Introduction to African Religion, 53.]
He is the "Great Spirit," the
"Creating Spirit and the Saving Spirit," and the "Protecting Spirit" who made
all the spirits in the universe (the Shona, the Ashanti, the Ewe, the Kagoro).

He is like wind; he comes and goes (the Ga, the Bena, and the Banyarwanda).
Mbiti notes that the Nuer’s word for God is spirit; thus, they believe his essence
is spirit.footnote:[J.S. Mbiti, Concepts of God in Africa (London: SPCK, 1970), 23f.]

God is also said to be responsible for both afflictions and salvation. Mbiti
has observed that several African peoples believe God is the reason behind
epidemics, calamities, destruction, death, pests, and cattle diseases (the Ambo,
the Azande, the Bambuti, the Bongo, the Bavenda, and the Suk). In some
cases, the personifications of God may be responsible for certain types of
afflictions. The personifications of God are known to send smallpox, spiritual
illnesses, bubonic plague, and even death.
footnote:[Mbiti, Concepts of God in Africa, 80-87.]
Whereas God is associated with
afflictions, Mbiti concludes that the African people also know him to be the
deliverer and savior. He always remembers and delivers those in trouble, the
ill, the poor, and the weak.
footnote:[Mbiti, Concepts of God in Africa, 82f.]
God delivers because he is king and lord.
footnote:[
This is seen among the Banyarwanda, the Barundi, the Edo, the Baluba, the Twi, the Akan,
the Bachwa, the Babuti, the Indem, the Ngoni, the Agikuyu, the Yoruba, the Zulu, the Bena,
and the Chagga, among others (Mbiti, Concepts of Ged in Africa, 71-73).]
As
the great king, he reigns over and owns all things, visible and invisible; he has
absolute power, maintains order in the sky, earth, and underworld, and may
not be approached directly but only via intermediaries.
footnote:[Mbiti, Concepts of God in Africa, 71-73.]
Since God is king
and lord, he is also viewed as master. Thus, he controls the destinies of all
things (the Banyarwanda, the Shongay, the Barundi), helps and teaches (the
Banyarwanda, the Ganda, the Baluba, the Barotse, the Meru, the Shilluk,
the Tswana, the Vugusu, the Mende, the Tiv, the Lodagaa), and, moreover, he
gives rain and material things as well as life as the most precious gift.
footnote:[Mbiti, Concepts of God in Africa, 73-76.]

God is the strong one (Yoruba, Ngombe); he is irresistible (Zulu), and able
to alter the natural laws and completely destroy both people and objects
(the Abaluhya, the Shona). He is the source of power (the Akan, the Ashanti).
God commands the created world, and it obeys (the Bambuti, Banyarwanda).
Even the rulers and the moral codes receive their powers from God—he is
the one "who gives or breaks dignities" (Banyarwanda, Zulu, the Lugbara).
footnote:[Mbiti, Concepts of God in Africa, 8-11; J.S. Mbiti, Introduction to African Religion, 50.]
In the African mind, reasons Mbiti, power is viewed "hierarchically in which
God is at the top as the omnipotent, beneath him are the spirits and natural
phenomena, and lower still are men who have comparatively little or no
power at all.footnote:[Mbiti, African Religions and Philosophy, 32.]

In these accounts and countless other metaphors in Mbiti’s Concepts of God
in Africa and in chapter 8 of my own The Doctrine of God in African Christian
Thought, one already sees his basic premise that pre-Christian Africa's ideas of
God and the early Israelites had many commonalities. In Mbitis thinking, the
commonalities, as they were perceived by pre-Christian Africa, served as preparatio evangelica that allowed indigenous people to recognize the missionaries’
account of God not only as what was familiar to them, but much more fundamentally as their own account of God.

## Gabriel M. Setiloane: The African Experiences God as _Mysterium Tremendum et Fascinans_

The basic concern of Setiloane is the absence of numinousness as a foundational
theological truth in Western theologies of God.
footnote:[ G.M. Setiloane, The Image of God among the Sotho-Twana
(Rotterdam: A.A. Balkema, 1976), 78.]
He is making his contribution in the context of what he sees as:

> ...the whole discussion in the West—focused in the "Honest to God" and the "Death
of God" theology—suggests that the West itself has lost the image of God as
"mysterium tremendum et fascinans," and deals, at the best, with a "creator absconditus," a
god of the gaps, or a saviour of individual souls destined for a pie in the sky.
footnote:[Setiloane, The Image of God, 229.]

For Setiloane, this way of understanding God is not only a threat to theology,
but also to the Christian faith. Consequently, he suggests that theology must
understand God not just rationally, but also as the _mysterium tremendum_ and
the _fascinans_.

Setiloane takes the ideas of the mysterium tremendum and the fascinans from
Robert Otto. The ideas convey:

> ...the daunting and the fascinating, now combine in a strange harmony of contrasts,
and the resultant dual character of the numinous consciousness, to which the entire
religious development bears witness, at any rate from the level of ‘demonic dread?
onward, is at once the strangest and most noteworthy phenomenon in the whole
history of religion. ‘The demonic-divine object may appear to the mind as an object
of horror and dread, but at the same time it is no less something that allures with
a potent charm, and the creature, who trembles before it, utterly cowed and cast down,
has always at the same time the impulse to turn to it, nay even to make it his own. ‘The
‘mystery’ is for him not merely something to be wondered at but something that
entrances him; and beside that in it which bewilders and confounds, he feels a something which captivates and transports him with a strange ravishment, rising often
enough to the pitch of dizzy intoxication; it is the Dionysiac-element in the numen.
footnote:[R. Otto, The Idea of the Holy (London: Penguin Books, 1923), 45.]

In this excerpt, Robert Otto associates God with such elements as ‘awefulness,’
‘overpoweringness, ‘energy’ or ‘urgency of the numinous,’ ‘wrath,’ ‘the wholly
other, and ‘fascination.’ Setiloane wraps all these elements in the Sotho-Tswana
term _selo_ which, in his thinking, is equivalent to mysterium tremendum
and _fascinans_.footnote:[G.M Setiloane, "MODIMO: GOD Among the Sotho-Tswana,"
Journal of Theology for Southern Africa, Number 4 (September 1973), 6-7.]
Setiloane argues that in the symbols of the Sotho-Tswana, _selo_
is described as _selo se se boitshengang, sa poitshego, se se tshabegang, se se mashwe_
("a fearful, awful, ugly, ugly, monstrous thing"). When _selo_ is applied to
Modimo (the name for God in Sotho-Tswana), the term conveys what
Otto calls _Ungeheuere, poitshego_, which is translated as "monstrous" or "weird."
footnote:[Setiloane, The Image of God, 78£; G.M. Setiloane, African Theology: An Introduction
(Johannesburg: Skotaville Publishers, 1986), 33.]
This allows Setiloane to describe Modimo as selo—'thing’ or ‘monster."
footnote:[ Setiloane, "MODIMO: GOD Among the Sotho-Tswana,." Gf. Cf.
Setiloane, African Theology, 226.]
He has personality, however. As Smith says, he is "in sharp distinction from
everyone and everything else.... He is a being who is not human, and never in
the recollection of men was human."footnote:[Smith, African Ideas of God, 216.]
Because _Modimo_ is _selo_, he is so intense
that the Sotho-Tswana approached him through _badimo_. Moreover, the name
_Modimo_ was a taboo and the Sotho-Tswana did not use it freely as did the
missionaries.footnote:[W.C. Willoughby explains that Modimo has to be
approached through the badimo (the ancestors) because he is "too great to
be approached by the mortals." See the details in W.C. Willoughby, The
Soul of the Bantu (London: SCM, 1928), 206ff. Setiloane notes, however,
that "despite the dangers of direct approach, IT can be called upon in
mortal danger" (Setiloane, The Image of God, 84).]
Setiloane explains that the Sotho-Tswana felt that the missionaries did
not recognize the greatness of Modimo enough because they used his
name so freely.
footnote:[The Sotho-Tswana still regard the use of the name _Modimo_
as taboo. For example, when _Modimo_ forms part of a personal name as it
stands, the part having the word is avoided in everyday use of the name,
"e.g. a child whose name is ‘Tiro-ya-Modimo’, the work of MODIMO,
would ordinarily be called simply ‘Tiro" (Setiloane, The Image of God, 235).]

## Christianization: The God of pre-Christian Africa is the God of Christian Faith

Whereas the discussions of Mbiti, Idowu, and Setiloane primarily targeted the
much hyped animist label, I see their real contribution in Christianizing
pre-Christian Africa’s sense of God. Already some amount of Christianization had
occurred when the vernacular Bibles read in African languages all over
sub-Saharan Africa used the local names for God. The true significance of this kind
of reconceptualization is the view that the God of the African pre-Christian
tradition has turned out to be the God of Christian worship.

This kind of identification is similar to what is seen in the relationship
between the Edomite Quas and Yahweh and the Canaanite _El_ and Yahweh.
Scholars of religion have not only been able to demonstrate that Yahweh
displays a number of _El_ characteristics, but they have also been able to observe
that the Hebrew Bible contains no polemic against _El_. Also, among the
Canaanites, Yahweh took over the name _El_, thus making it the gate through
which Yahweh penetrated the Semitic world.footnote:[See D. Bosch, "God in
Africa: Implications for Kerygma," Missionalia Volume 1 No 1 (1973), 3-21;
cf. CELL. Heureux, Rank Among the Canaanite Gods: El, Ball and Rephaim (Ann
Arbor: Scholars Press, 1979).]
A similar situation occurs in relating the Edomites Quas to Yahweh.
J.R. Bartlett argues as follows:

> it is quite remarkable that the Old Testament, while firmly condemning Ammonite
Milcom and Moabites Chemosh as ‘abominations’ neither names nor condemns any
Edomite God. ‘The difference in treatment requires explanation. It may be a matter of
chance, or of Israel's ignorance of Edomite belief, but perhaps the most likely
explanation is that there was some awareness in Israel that Yahweh belonged to the Edomite
region and that the Edomites themselves might be among his worshippers.
footnote:[J.R. Bartlett, "Yahweh and Quas: A Response to Martin Rose" in SOT 5 (1978), 29-38.]

Just as Quas and _El_ were Yahwehized in the case of the Edomites and the
Canaanites, respectively, so were _Modimo_, _Nyame_, _Nyasaye_, _Ngai_, _Mulungu_,
and so on.

The Christianization of _Nyasaye_, for instance, means that the Luo Christian
now experiences _Nyasaye_ as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. In this case, _Nyasaye_
has become Christianized. In addition to merely being Nyasaye of the
pre-Christian Luo, it is more significant that the referent for the Luo name,
_Nyasaye_, has been reconceptualized and transformed into the God of Christian
worship—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Here, the most important item in
African religious heritage has clearly obtained a Christian meaning.

## Africanization: Reconceptualizing Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit in the African Cultural Milieu

In this paper, Africanization is considered to be the equivalent of
Hellenization of the Christian faith as it occurred in the early church.
Under Hellenization, the church utilized Greek metaphysics to describe
Christian concepts to the indigenous Greek culture. Africanization here
then is the use of African intellectual culture to explain the triune God
to African audiences. This therefore means that—of necessity—the Trinity must
emerge from _Nzambi_, _Nyambe_, _Ndyambi_, _Dzambi_, _Tiambi_, _Yambe_,
_Sambi_, _Zam_, _Monzam_, _Nyasaye_ and so on, and is not borrowed from
outside. In other words, _Nyasaye_,
for instance, is now known to the Luo Christian as Father, Son, and the Holy
Spirit. This reconceptualization of God has come about as a result of the
manner in which we meet God and see him revealed in the pages of the Bible. The
process, however, involves re-identification and inculturation of monotheism,
as well as reconceptualization of both the Son and the Holy Spirit.

## Re-identification

African Christians are to determine their own identity. In this task, African
Christians are to separate themselves from the Greco-Roman influence that
came with missionary Christianity, distinguish themselves from the expanding
Muslim population, and critically draw from African religious consciousness
without reverting to African traditional religions. African Christians are a new
people, a new race, and a new _evhne_, and their numbers are explosive. By 1900,
Africa had 8.7 million Christians. This figure rose to 60 million in the 1960s.
By the year 2000, Africa had 360 million Christians, and this figure is poised
to reach 633 million in the year 2025.
footnote:[L. Sanneh, Whose Religion is Christianity? The Gospel Beyond the
West (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans Publishing Company, 2003), 14.]
This numerical strength simply means
that "Africa has become, or is becoming a Christian continent in cultural as
well as numerical terms."footnote:[Sanneh, Whase Religion is Christianity? 36.]

The call for re-identification finds resonance in the New Testament and in
the experience of the church fathers. In the New Testament writings, the
identity of Christianity as a "race, a nation, a people" is evident.
footnote:[See 1 Pet. 2: 9.]
In his reference to the Christians, Peter preferred to use "a race, a nation, a people."
In contrast, Paul speaks about "the Jews, the Greeks, and the community of faith."
footnote:[See 1 Cor. 10: 32; and ef. John 4: 21ff.]
By the time of the church fathers, this triple division on the basis of religion
and worship had become accepted as a basis for developing a distinct Christian
consciousness in the Greco-Roman context.footnote:[Bediako, Theology and Identity, 36.]

Fundamental to re-identification is conversion—turning the African world
to Christ. In his comment on conversion, Andrew Walls says:

> To become a convert... is to turn, and turning involves not a change of substance
but a change of direction. Conversion, in other words, means to
_turn what is already there in a new direction_.
It is not a matter of substituting something new for something
old—that is proselytizing, a method which the early church could have adopted but
deliberately chose to jettison. Nor is conversion a matter of adding something new to
something old, as a supplement or in a synthesis. Rather Christian conversion involves
redirecting what is already there, turning it in the direction of Christ. That is what the
earliest Jerusalem believers had already done with their Jewish inheritance. Turning
that inheritance toward Messiah Jesus transformed the inheritance but did not destroy
its coherence or its continuity. On the contrary, it produced a model of thought and
life that was Christian because Jesus was at its center; yet it remained essentially and
inalienably Jewish.
footnote:[
A.B Walls, "Old Athens and New Jerusalem: Some Signposts for Christian Scholarship in
the Early History of Mission Studies," International Bulletin of Missionary Research
(October 1997), 148.]

## Worship of one God: Monotheism

Pre-Christian Africa had a form of monotheism that has been called "primitive
monotheism" or "diffused monotheism,"footnote:[The concept of ‘primitive monotheism’
or ‘diffused monotheism! may be traced to the middle of the 19th century. Some of
the early discussants of this concept include Henry Callaway, ‘Andrew Lang, and
Edwin W. Smith. See the books: Henry Callaway, The Religious Systems of the
Amazulu (London: Routledge and Kagan Paul, 1870), Andrew Lang, The Making of Religion
(London: Longmans, 1909), and Edwin W. Smith, Affican Ideas of God (London: Edinburgh
Press, 1950). The other serious discussants of this concept are E.E. Evans-Pritchard,
Nuer Religion (London: Oxford University Press, 1956) and G. Lienharde, Divinity
and Experience: The Religion of the Dinka (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1961).]
ably defined by Bolaji Idowu as a
type of monotheism, where "the good Deity delegates certain portions of his
authority to certain divine functionaries who work as they are commissioned
by Him."footnote:[ Idowu, Oludumare, 62, cited in Kombo, The Doctrine of God in
African Christian Thought, 169, 170; see also Schmidt, The Origin and Growth of
Religion, 262-282.]
The Yoruba, for instance, recognize the supremacy of _Oludumare_
but they also have innumerable divinities. No one really knows the actual
number of the Yoruba divinities, they simply call them _orisa_, meaning ‘legion."
footnote:[RJ.Gehman, Afican Traditional Religion in Biblical Perspective
(Kijabe: Kesho Publications, 1989), 125.]
Indeed, research has not been able to offer a reasonable account of the divinities
among the people of West Africa, Central Africa, Southern Africa, and parts of
East Africa. The divinities among these people are simply too numerous and complex.

Note however, that pre-Christian African religious consciousness had no
place for polytheism—the worship of many gods. D.C. Scott writes about
God as he is perceived among the Nyanja people and says, for instance, that
"you cannot put the plural with God because God is one. There are no idols
called gods, and spirits are spirits of the people who have died, not gods...
[H]ence God is one, is a distinct person, cannot be identified with the powers
of nature, nor confounded with spirits in general."footnote:[D.C. Scott,
Dictionary of the Nyanja Language (London: Religious Tract Society, 1929), 348.]
Kwame Bediako comes to
a similar conclusion when he writes that "virtually all African indigenous languages make a distinction between Supreme God and the divinities, ancestors
and natural forces that are not God. Worshipers know who is God, and who
is not.footnote:[K. Bediako, "Their Past is also our Present. Why all Christians
Have a Need of Ancestors: Making a Case for Africa," AJCMAR Bulletin Vol 6 (2007), 11.]
In all this discussion, there is ample clarity about ‘primitive monotheism and its attendant intermediaries, on the one hand, and polytheism, on
the other hand.

Conversion now requires the African worshiper to turn around ‘primitive
monotheism’ in the direction of Christ. Situating Christ and the Holy Spirit
in the center of primitive monotheism has the effect of expunging the agency
of the intermediaries, powers of nature, or spirits from the service of deity.
‘This is then the fundamental difference between primitive monotheism and
Christian monotheism. The other difference, of course, is in the way the divine
category is conceived. Whereas in primitive monotheism, God is a monad—
although he employs the services of intermediaries—in Christian monotheism
the one God is Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—yet, they are not three lords, but
one lord without intermediaries.

The readers of vernacular Bibles are convinced that the monotheism that
speaks to African spirituality arises out of their experience of God displayed in
the pages of the Bible. The Luo Bible translators, for instance, used Nyasaye as
referring to God, and wherever the term ‘Father’ appears in the text of the
Bible, the Luo translators of the Bible rendered it _Nyasaye Wuoro_ (God the
Father). Thus, the Luo Christians see God (_Nyasaye_) and the Father (_Wuoro_) as
mutually interchangeable. In everyday worship, God the Father
(_Nyasaye Wuoro_), God the Son (_Nyasaye Wuowi_), and God the Holy Spirit
(_Nyasaye Roho Maler_) are confessed. These vernacular readers of the Luo
Bible and converts to Christianity understand the confession of Father, Son,
and Holy Spirit as worship of one God (monotheism), not in the ‘common substance-essence’
terms of the Greco-Roman heritage, nor in the ‘monotheism as one-ness,
non-divisible essence’ in Islam footnote:[
Skarsaune, "Is Christianity Monotheistic? A Perspective on a Jewish/Christian Debate,"
Studia Patristica 29 (1957), 340-363, 348. Cf. H.A. Wolfson, "The Muslim Attributes and the
" HTR 49 (1956), 1-18.]
and Neo-Platonism, nor as monotheism oneness
in the sense of an ‘absolute subject’ in the Idealism philosophy. Here the
oneness of God is confessed in the context of the fatherhood as contemplated
from the point of view of the Great _Muntu_, whose _NTU_ is split between the
Son and the Holy Spirit. In this case, the Father is the Great _Muntu_ (God)
who uniquely shares the Divine _NTU_ with the Son and the Holy Spirit. For
the Luo Christian, for instance, this must of necessity mean that the Son and
the Holy Spirit are now constitutive in the identity of Nyasaye or monotheism.
In other words, the Luo Christian can no longer conceive of the eternal identity of Nyasaye (monotheism) without splitting the same between the Son and
the Holy Spirit.footnote:[
See Kombo, The Doctrine of God in African Christian Thought, 245-247, for a derailed
discourse on the application of the _NTU_ metaphysics to the Trinity. The primary meaning of
‘person’ in the African context is "the genuine Muntu." The "genuine muntu" in human persons
is only a "tributary" of the "Great _Muntu_" ot simply a reflection of the "Great _Muntu_." But to say
that the Son is a person is not the same as saying that he is a person in the sense that you and I
are persons. The "genuine Muntu" that you and I have, are but tributaries of the "Great _Muntu_."
The "genuine Muntu" that the Son has, is the "Great _Muntu_" himself. Thus, the Son is a perfect
reflection of the "Great _Muntu_," the Holy Spirit is a perfect reflection of the "Great _Muntu_," and
the Father is a perfect reflection of the "Great _Muntu_." Thus the Son is a person in the ultimate
sense, the Holy Spirit is a person in the ultimate sense, and the Father is a person in the ultimate
sense. Just as each of us reveal the nature of the "genuine Muntu," the little "tributary" of God in
each of us, so the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spitit fully reveal the "
can fully reveal the "Great _Muntu_" except an ultimate person, and we know of three ultimate
persons from Christian theology: the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Persons cannot exist
in isolation. These ultimate persons have always existed and will always exist in a community.

Indigenous Church (London: Oxford University Press, 1965), 19.]

Would this amount to polytheism? Not at all because the Christian faith
has always seen itself as monotheistic in the same way the Rabbinic thought of
the second century did.
footnote:[See Justin Martyr's Dialogue with Trypho the Jew, chapters 10 - 19 and 55-63.]
Justin Martyr raised the matter of the existence of ητερος θεος
with Trypho.footnote:[Justin Martyr, Dialogue, 55.1.]
In the argumentation of Justin Martyr, "Christ,
not the Father, was the one who appeared in the theophanies of the Old Testament...
he is to be identified with God’s Wisdom, who is spoken of in the
Bible as a second divine person, begotten by God, but not separated from
him."footnote:[
O. Skarsaune, "Is Christianity Monotheistic? A Perspective on a Jewish/Christian Debate,"
in Studia Patristica vol 29, 1957: 357; cf. Justin Martyr, Dialogue, 56-62, 126-129.]
In response to this thesis, Trypho the Jew does not say that that particular position destroys the Christian claim to monotheism. In fact, Trypho
already believes that the Christians reject idolatry and, at the same time, admits
that the scripture may know a ητερος θεος
footnote:[Skarsaune, "Is Christianity Monotheistic? " 362.]
The implication of this submission in the pre-Nicene sources is that the divinity
of Christ and of the Holy Spirit does not reject the Jewish understanding of
monotheism. In fact, there is a general lack of awareness that the admission
of the divinity of the Son and of the Holy Spirit may create theological problems
to the Jewish concept of monotheism.
footnote:[Skarsaune, "Is Christianity Monotheistic? " 355.]

Islamic religion and African traditional religions may reject Christian
monotheism. Their reasons for rejecting the Christian stand are not theological. Scholars of African religions who reject Christian monotheism do so on
cosmological ground. J.N.K. Mugambi, for instance, believes that the ‘persons’
in the Trinity should be done away with because, in the African mind,
"they are misleading, vague and confusing."
footnote:[J.N.K. Mugambi, The African Heritage and Contemporary Christianity
(Nairobi: Longman, 1989), 75, 77.]
Studies on Islamic polemics of
the Middle Ages, on the other hand, indicate that the Muslims’ rejection of
Christian monotheism was based on their understanding of the Neo-Platonic
concepts of essence and attributes.
footnote:[Skarsaune, "Is Christianity Monotheistic?" 347.]
According to the Neo-Platonic doctrines
of essence and attributes, plurality presupposes materiality of the underlying
substance.footnote:[ Aristotle, Metaphysics (England: Oxford University Press,
1912-1952). See particularly XIL8.1074A.]
Since God is not material, he cannot be said to be plural.

## The Incarnation

The Bible shows the Son in a manner that requires belief that God became
incarnate, suffered on the cross, and redeemed mankind by dying and rising again.
footnote:[
In Justin Martyr's _Dialogue with Trypho_, Judaism is portrayed as having no problems with
the issue of a "second God" (see _Dialogue_ 16; 57.1; 58.2; 60.3; 63.1), however, Judaism
recoils at the idea that this other God actually became man. In _Dialogue_r
68.1, Trypho says: "You are enduring to prove an incredible and almost impossible thing,
that God endured to be born and to become man!"]
In other words, God endured to be born, to become man, and to suffer. Thus, as Fulton has clearly observed, "nowhere is the union of God and
man so concrete and definite, and so universal in its import as in the Christian
religion."
footnote:[W. Fulton, "Trinity," Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics (Edinburgh: T&T Clark, 1921), 458.]
Some of the biblical passages which lend themselves to this interpretation are (1) passages of identity which posit simple identity of Christ with
God, (2) passages of distinction which distinguish one ‘lord’ from another
‘lord, and (3) passages of derivation which suggest that the Son is from the
Father.
footnote:[J. Pelikan, The Christian Tradition (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1971), 175.]

Why is incarnation important to Africa? In answering this question, I refer
to John S. Mbiti’s long held view that the African is incurably religious.
For him,

> ..[it] is highly doubtful that even at their very best, those other religious systems and
ideologies current in Africa ate saying anything radically new to, and different from
what is already embedded in Christianity. And yet the strength and uniqueness of
Christianity do not lie in the fact that its teaching, practice and history have all the
major elements of the other religious traditions. The uniqueness of Christianity is in
Jesus Christ.... [It] is He, therefore, and only He, who deserves to be the goal and
standard for individuals and mankind... I consider traditional religions, Islam and
other religious systems to be preparatory and even essential ground in the search for
the Ultimate. But only Christianity has the terrible responsibility of pointing the way
to that Ultimate Identity, Foundation and Source of security.
footnote:[Mbiti, African Religions and Philosophy, 277.]

The uniqueness of Christ must mean, therefore, that he is not just a friend,
liberator, elder brother, ancestor, brother, king/chief, healer, master of initia~
tion, and so on. More importantly, he is God himself. In other words, the
genuine Muntu of the Son is the Great _Muntu_ himself. The Son is therefore a
perfect reflection of the Great _Muntu_—God himself.
footnote:[Kombo, The Doctrine of God in African Christian Thought, 245.]

The African thinking says that salvation and deliverance belong to God. He
always remembers and delivers those in trouble, the ill, the poor, and the
weak.footnote:[Mbiti, Concepts of God in Africa, 826.]
He performs these functions because he is king and lord.
footnote:[This is seen among the Banyarwanda, the Barundi, the Edo, the Baluba,
the Twi, the Akan, the Bachwa, the Babuti, the Indem, the Ngoni, the Agikuyu,
the Yoruba, the Zulu, the Bena, and the Chagga, among others (Mbiti, Concepts
of God in Africa, 71-73).]
As the great
king, he reigns over and owns all things, visible and invisible; he has absolute
power and maintains order in the sky, earth, and underworld.
footnote:[Mbiti, Concepts of God in Africa, 71-73.]
He controls and commands of all things, helps, and teaches, and moreover, he gives
rain and material things, as well as life—the most precious gift.
footnote:[Mbiti, Concepts of God in Africa, 73-76.]
Even the rulers and the moral codes receive their powers from God.
footnote:[Mbiti, Concepts of God in Africa, 8-11; Mbiti, Introduction to African Religion, 50.]

The Bible seems to say that salvation and deliverance belong to Christ. To
the African Christian mind, this must mean that Christ is God contemplated
from king, lord, and savior. Christ is therefore not a ‘mode of God,’ as
indicated by Idealism, nor is he a mere attribute of God, as Judaism and Islam
would accept. Similarly, Christ is not Nommo—‘the son of God’—in the sense
of the Dogon, and neither is he one of the two sons of God as the Ganda
believe, nor merely a god in the sense of being one of the sons of God who is
conceived to be the father of gods.
footnote:[Mbiti, Concepts of God in Africa, 114-116.]
Christ is God because he shares in the
_NTU_ of God and as such he is king, lord, and savior. Salvation and deliverance
in Christ are all encompassing and extend to the entire African world—they
apply to all the elements in the African world: the spirits, man, animals and
plants, and even phenomena and objects without biological life (such as rocks,
time, beauty, authority and so on). The Son, therefore, saves mankind and
presents him/her as holy and blameless before God, but his salvation has direct
consequences to the entire ranges of wmuntu (all the life forces with intelligence),
_ikintu_ (things, objects, animals, plants and minerals), _ahantu_ (place
and time), and _ukuntu_ (modalities in which power acts, such as quality, quantity,
relation, action, passion, position, and possession).
footnote:[For an indepth analysis of the _NTU_ philosophy, see Kombo, The Doctrine
of God in African Christian Thought, 151-153.]

## The Pneumatological Question

Pre-Christian Africa perceived God as a spiritual being and not having a material
body. God is "the Great Spirit, the Fathomless Spirit, the Ever-Present
Spirit or the God of Wind and Breath."
footnote:[Mbiti, Introduction to African Religion, 53.]
He is the "Great Spirit," the "Creating
Spirit and the Saving Spirit" and the "Protecting Spirit."
footnote:[Mbiti, Concepts of God in Africa, 236.]
These terms
simply denote that God is a spiritual being. But the African conceptual framework also has spirits as a special category. Spirits are part of _umuntu_, but they
have a higher _NTU_ than some forms of existence within muntu (e.g., man)
and, therefore, they can influence them. The spirits can also influence _ikintu_,
_ahantu_, and _ukuntu_. On this account, the Holy Spirit presented the first translators of the Bible into the African languages with a special difficulty because
they needed to separate the Holy Spirit from God, on the one hand, and from
the spirits, on the other hand.

There are African words for ‘holy’ and ‘spirit’ but, as Mbiti explains, "... the
combination which gives us the "Holy Spirit’ as part of the Trinity is
specifically Christian heritage."
footnote:[Mbiti, "The Holy Spirit in African Independent Churches," 103.]
In the context of the Bantus of East Africa, for
instance, the Kiswahili word, Roho, was adopted to represent the concept of
the Holy Spirit instead of the vernacular words for spirit.
footnote:[Mugambi, The African Heritage and Contemporary Christianity, 65.]
The Protestant
Acholi of Uganda adopted _Cwiny Maleng_ (heart), while their Catholic
counterparts adopted _Tipu Maleng_ (shadow, depiction, and ancestral spirit), and
Maleng that specifically refer to either physical or ethical purity."
footnote:[H. Behrend, Alice Lakwena and the Holy Spirits: War in Northern
Uganda 1985-97 (Nairobi: EAEP, 1999), 116.]
Although
(from these two examples) the new concept Roho and Cwiny Maleng or Tipu
Maleng refer to the third person of the Trinity, the exact reference of the
theological terms, _Roho_, _Cwiny Maleng_, or _Tipu Maleng_, has remained elusive
to many African Christians due to the traditional interferences imposed by
cosmological structures.

There is so much mention of the Holy Spirit in African Christianity, but
there is very little by way of reflective theology on the same. Theology that will
adequately distinguish the Holy Spirit as the third person of the Trinity, it
seems to me, will seek to proceed as follows: 1) distinguish the spirits in
African cosmology from the Holy Spirit; 2) relate the Holy Spirit to Christ;
footnote:[Pelikan, The Christian Tradition, 213.]
and 3) relate the Holy Spirit to the Father. The spirits in African cosmology are
part of wmuntu, and they can control _ikintu_, _ahantu_, and _ukuntu_. The Bible
depicts the Holy Spirit who operates in the church (gives gifts, sanctifies,
empowers, and so on) and in the world’s history as the same Spirit who
exegetes the Father. He is the very same Spirit of Yahweh who was known in
Israel. The Holy Spirit is God—the Great _Muntu_ himself. As such, he sustains
the spirits and all elements of _umuntu_, _ikintu_, _ahantu_, and _ukuntu_ because he
is the Great _Muntu_ himself. The pneumatological problem in Africa will be
how to separate the spirits in African existence, on the one hand, and how to
differentiate from each other the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, on the
other hand.

## Concluding Remarks: Christianity is an African Religion

God has revealed himself as one, yet, we in the Christian faith have experienced
him as Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit. This view, explains Karl Rahner,

> [confirms]... that knowledge of the unique, transcendent, personal God which is
always stirring into life whether naturally or supernaturally. ... Second, the Christian
conception will always express God's passionate protest against every kind of polytheistic or pantheistic deification of the world. ... Third, it alone will be able to say unambiguously and definitively just how the personal, transcendent desires in actual fact
stand to the world in his sovereign freedom: namely, as the God who actually discloses
his inmost self to man out of grace."
footnote:[K. Rahner, Theological Investigations |. Trans. C. Ernest. (London: Darton, Longman and Todd, 1965), 85, 86.]
 
Africa exists in what Ali Mazrui has called the triple heritage: African
traditional religions, Islam, and European influence. Note that Ali Mazrui
writes in the mid 1980s and speaks about two major religions of Africa, but omits
Christianity—apparently because he prefers to place it into the rubric of
European influence.
footnote:[A.A. Mazrui, The African: A Triple Heritage (Boston: Little, Brown, 1986).]
When Okot p’Bitek wrote in the 1970s as an apologist
for the African consciousness, he also did not have kind words for African
Christianity.

research that, in our own time, Christianity has become an African religion.
This paper is an attempt to bring this new African religion to testify most
effectively, truthfully, and reverently of the inexplicable Great _Muntu_ who has
revealed himself to us in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
